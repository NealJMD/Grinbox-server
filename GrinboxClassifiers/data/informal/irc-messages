"denounce" and "snitch" map out two very distant points on the formality spectrum.. how can I limit the speed of my internet connection to say, 100 KB/s ?. tell it to manpages Jaymie ;-). (but I guess snitch has to be "snitch on" it's to mean denounce). something with "iptables" ?.

snitch is someone who's a rat. informant. use Dialup. capo. etc. hahaha :P.

no I can't I have a weird modem. he's a very considerate broadband user. his ISP must love him. perspective makes the difference between a whistleblower and a snitch.. a tonsure? ;). come on, please!.

hey wat's up ?. Elma, no I mean like always. throughout. why is it so?. bye folks. heu... not a damn clue, sorry... but why are using a 2.4 kernel?.
}{
Shenna, what are you trying to do?. i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6. but 2.6 gives errors on my laptop. Shenna, what errors?. something like : kernel panic .. specify correct root=.... lol.
}{
i am using lilo. slackware. on my pc it works fine. Shenna, right go to lilo and change root to sd whatever. i tried that. and?.
}{
didn't work. same error?. waah.... oh. does it have ide or sata cables. linux not booting.
}{
it is a laptop. oh. can't check. just got it. hm. not ubunut though.
}{
linux is cool. openmosix seems dope. Shenna, use knoppix. it says :  hda..... etc. right.
}{
2.4 you are not going to get it right. k. 2.4 limited sata support?. #windows. : hmm... Rasterizing........... @ 600 DPI ^_^.
}{
what is that?. Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Device Manager -> Disk Drives right-click/properties/details. SHOWERR. ^_^. gaah. i have forgotten how to use windows.
}{
isn't it such a pleasure?. i guess except when people ask windows question. still a pleasure to me, to hell with dumb questions ;). i have no idea why hes tarding around with 2.4. because it has no root exploits!. 2.6 is just waiting to get exploited!.
}{
so hes setting up a large scale secure network?. slack uses 2.4??. slack is crazy. glad i never messed with it. hey it is a hitachi hts541612j9sa00. puppy debian ubuntu and elive is what i boot.
}{
just debian, here. i have about 130 gb of distro-less space but my connection is too slow to be downloading others. slackware has 2.6 available, just not default. What's the best way to create a Kiosk term using Linux?. the internet says it is sata. i have a acer aspire 5583. pounces around.
}{
anyone here uses LilyPond?. any newer aspire is definitely sata. dissected a few recently. http://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/menuitem.dac393208bfae6f199558fe7eac4f0a0/. check this. these are the specs.
}{
I question that site!. why?. it is the hitachi site. <Lizeth> i have forgotten how to use windows <-- life is good. hey, i will be compiling the kernel today, so any suggestions so that it will work. i have 2.6.21 to compie.
}{
*compile. http://research.indocisc.com/~andika/acer/acer-aspire-5580.html. i searched this thorough linux-laptop. gah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. what happened?. yeah, I would go with 2.6.21 unless your distro is good about backporting security.
}{
Shenna, another jerk wrote horrible code and unleashed it on the planet. that was me sorry. so i guess it is the correct one. indeed. but it's something to check out. linuxSUCKS.

}{
doot doot doot... another one bites the dust. what kind of laptop are you using?. a norwegian windows user, :). this shitty code came from, of all people, one of the founders of AutoDesk. is it a surprise?. Gale, its sad and disheartening.
}{
yeah. Gale, i expect my government to lie to me. autocad is retarded. Gale, but the OSS community rants endlessly about code quality that doesnt seem to exist. runs like its broken. it's a mixed bag.
}{
that runs on linux. its not like there are 1,000's of them ... theres 1. load ~/.darkstar/darkstar.irc. whoops.. I haven't used that particular one. what? huh? i never said anything about you.
}{
backpeddalers. i've yet to hear that ever... but ok. it's like anything else.  Has it's ups and downs. i just posted a message to the mailing list. anyone wanna bet money on the fact that i get a "sorry, doesnt exist, use the souce" response ?. I hope you used foul language.
}{
Margene, nah, but i did have 2 or 3 typos. too many goofy acronyms. Maegan, lock taskbar. does anyone run an ipv4 tunnel through ipv6 ?. nothing should ever be seen on windows. except maybe a little devil gif flipping the bird.
}{
with ballmer's face pasted on it. Margene, don't wanna be a troll, but windows does have it's advantages. youtube rocks :D. troll!!!!! ;). youtube sucks, lol. arwen your a fool.
}{
you suck wipe. and what's that?  Windows Genuine Advantage?. death to all extremists! ... oops. well you have to admit, having an advantage is advantageous. i feel so advantaged by that, actually. hosting?.
}{
i am talking about watching you idiot. I prefer Google Video tho. yeah, the advantage is not having it. !seen Quiznos. I call it dependency heaven. German, Windows has Crysis, end of argument :P.
}{
hi pingfloyd. yo.. Hildegard, hi. haha, Crysis will bomb. bunch of hype. I bet otherwise.
}{
I'd put money on it but I don't think that's very freenode :P. now leave me be. well ok, gamer nerds always trend up on everything, but it's hype, so is directx10. licensing and sale of?. Hildegard, the ebay thing?. yup.
}{
Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery). yes, it's a bigger hype than usual. gonna go over the legal side with a fine tooth comb tomorrow probably. what did you come up with?. hi Arlie. Paulita, they love killing the messenger.
}{
I don't know all the details of gnome, but those are just text files that gconf uses. haha. afaik. http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm. :D. good.
}{
cause now i know you too. shutting down a powerseller, awesomeness.. Paulita, im sure it looks exactly like my home town. there is a major difference between a monkey hole and a bahia brazil ;). why bother asking here?. yeah a distro.
}{
yeah ... not too many glue sniffing street kids around here ... they all smoke weed. Check "linuxonlaptops". ok tnx. they drink beer here. is it a low spec laptop?. 128 mb ram so low spec yeah.
}{
128mb is hardly low spec :-p. hardly. 128 millibits is quite low. tell it to my octo core with 16gb ram. No.. Your confusing low with ancient... Christiana, I used to have one with 2MB.
}{
omg :o. umm... your "standard" windows 95 computer came with 32-48MB RAM. hey people why doesnt PHP channel work? it sayz overfloww when i try to type...... i use a 64 bit windows vista with 3 gb ram :P. Yeah.. And that's VERY old... my first computer had 4kB of ram, a trs-80. :).
}{
Lynda, php is buggy like that. 4kb?. heh.. What OS runs on 4 KB ?. basic. ;).
}{
Lynda, you must register on freenode. thanks... darn i got to fix a stupid problem... :(((. win 95 was 8-16 mb ram wasn't it?. probably means the channel is full.. I never used windows 95, it seems to run like crap. lose 95 was 32mb.
}{
Jeanice, it sure ran on my 16mb, dunno about 8 though. my atari 400 only had 16k. Play with the BIOS or something?. I remember lose 98 was pretty fast on 64mb. Christiana, what bios ?. thanks !.
}{
98 was pretty fast even with 32, come to think of it.. i never had 98. Bios is a blue screen with buttons when i pres F1 when pc boots, it says PASSWORD and BIOS. Lynda, no idea. German, never had that, not even a firewall. ME was a disaster.
}{
Margene, oh right:D windows 98 wasn't geared towards the internet. Windows ME sucks, ERROR this ERROR that. screw microsoft ... they suck !. Christiana, no shit?. loves hating ms. Ya rlly.
}{
W MILAN. Margene, lol... real people used Win NT. and I like pointing out that you don't seem to know the definition of "communism" :). agrees with Renate. Renate, yeah, those imaginary people were weird. Nicki, doesn't matter.... I said "look like".
}{
Margene, my bad. Margene, hehe. THANKS GUYS!! :)). real people still use NT. Anal Butt Monkeys, now playing on the video streamer!. FOSS is communism comrades!.
}{
bring down this MS capitalist pig!. jackson browne had a hit with running on NT. that's GNU/communism. microsoft is another enron. Microsoft is loaded with cash, Respect.. just started a flamewar! lol.
}{
Hildegard broke a leg!. Christiana, thats because the stock they give to employees isnt on the balance sheet. it's my shoulder, actually.. those servers are pretty dangerous, eh?. Hildegard, lemme guess, a blade rack fell on it?. what stock?.
}{
no.. Christiana, right ;). I have no clue yet, but it's probably arthritis :/. NT still sounds close enough to empty, and damn fine description. Stock means Stick So what the pell?!. NT is XP and Vista.
}{
it's the NT kernel. I dont eat bananas.. Ruthe, the fact that there isn't one?. Christiana, you should, they have lots of potassium goodness. Renate, xp computer finds it. not plugged into same network? :).
}{
I eat cardboard boxes because of the fibers.. dkkr, plugged directly to cable modem. No whil watching JENSEN. try resetting your cable modem. or turning it on .... Rock On!: http://www.myspace.com/thezimmersband  Talking bout my ge-neration!.
}{
generations suck. xp cn get online. Becuz its cewl. because they are retards.. Margene, because they want to pull you down to their level. They prolly tlk lik dis on d intrnet nd use x-marx 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! alot lik dat.
}{
If even osama bin laden has a myspace, and u dont ,u rgettin old or unliked.. has just been there serving iax2 till this morning. I'm not getting old or unliked, well getting old, already unliked. oh cripes, AOheLL. heh. and isn't myspace just a big pedophile ring.
}{
why would they want to attack their breeding grounds?~. hackers maybe, not "hackers" !. i figured this was the perfect song to accompany the Mexodus to Amerika :D http://youtube.com/watch?v=8_B1BcDFdQY. Ruthe, we're running out of options here. is the person you are talking to, trustworthy and intelligent ?. Angla, trustworthy, not intelligent. bingo.
}{
yeah. o.o. weasely dumbasses are a waste of air. my new kernel doesn't have /dev/sh*. did you try /etc/init.d/networking restart?. is the *other* end of the cable plugged into the computer ?.
}{
just to be on the safe side. stab's th pirate. :P. Angla, yes, the person im talking to has plugged the cable to the computer before. is there another cable to try ?. there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?.
}{
is starting to hate his custom kernel. Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on. and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit. the kicker is the kicker. yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere. no the stock kernel is fine.
}{
i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks. and i wanted initng. the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far. KDE4 is vaporware.... Santo, not go, but try it out. ah.
}{
or like I always say, ". ?. the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great. When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't. what went wrong?. compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck.
}{
yeah, being methodical is a big part. ah, personally i don't use the progress bars. I'm not a big fan of kget :-\. ok i have an ext3 image. i did not unmount it cleanly. what distro?.
}{
its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3. (scripting). kubuntu. pcap injects ethernet packets. they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever. Renate, I dunno, it just happens.
}{
magic, zomg! :o.O. you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes. Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?. Julietta, or you can steal someones connection. Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation. i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation).
}{
Hmm. good morning. A hacked version.. vs just showing filename.jpg?. And still the same behavious. Hmmm. Weird indeed ...
}{
Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state. strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?. Ya. I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?. fair enough. Priscila, yeah.
}{
Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm. rather than reinstalling another system. Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.. sounds like you want find.... Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO. yeah.
}{
on application level ?. like grab a handle to another apps socket. Felicia, heh =P. does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?. i smiled or sure ;-). er for*.
}{
http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I. Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap. Julietta, use a proxy. haha. hmm, yeah. no thanks required, just send money.
}{
13963 ##linux :  mode (-o Kacy ) by Kacy. it means it uses dos eol. i don't think it matters thou, cause It works. Hmm, reinstalled PAM, no change... ey ey ey ey. what is %s/.

I can't press DOWN arrow ?. Oh, oh, gotta be a cracklib problem... ok, problem solved, thanks Angla, Gale. what was it>?. it's like this :%s/oldstring/newstring/options. ah okay.
}{
I will just use :/bEnabled :). and unplugged. there's also another variant that :s/oldstring/newstring/options. and :n1, n2s/oldstring/newstring/options. that's how most are that I've come acrossed. hello everyone.
}{
how can i force the termination of a proccess?. reps. it's handled by the os. thanks :) All worked. Nestor. so it would relearn the xp mac.

heh. but you should always send SIGTERM first. i've tried sending SIGTERM but that didn't work either. Gale, yep, thats what did it. yes, that one worked. when their is some weirdness going on.

yea why not. I am ready!. http://youtube.com/watch?v=w-l036TANTQ. Nestor, err nm, that wont work. ok.. yuh!.

hehe ok. should i post a mialing address to send it to?. !seen Kacy. this would be a one shot thing tho cuz i cant rejoin later to remind. Here's a hint.  Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10.  (yes, I know it's likely literally true.  But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.)). Arlie, my brother told me that one?.
}{
ah ok. hello Azzie. what whatever?. huh?. Hello there, how is it going?. Nicki, it happens everywhere.
}{
i figured to keep it a bit erm private. Arlie, that's interesting. cynic. :). its human nature. how are you?. ok i'm bumming here; fizzle.

Well, end of semester work, what could be better?. Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling. hmm yeah maybe you're right...

Yea, but you learn a lesson i guess.. croatia aint much better. And my parents are fucking crazy.  Totally fucked with my head... couldn't stand life so I dropped out of school even though I had a full ride.  :(. white  or indian ?. white. or gipsy lol.
}{
haha. close. maybe you meant to say that to Madison?. he did. you still speak romanian?. fluent ?.
}{
ahh. i need to learn another language. Felicia, he doesnt need money, he needs a "financial stability plan" that he's willing to follow. i speak english spanish and portuguese but spanish and portuguese are kinda close so yea. lol. Who needs financial stability, just buy drink and drugs and women..
}{
you like ?. i can't disagree with what you're saying .. that's all io will say about that right now .. especially since i'm tired. i think when i was 7 i spoke half-assed-fluent italian because i watched italian-dubbed anime all day long. english is still a latin language just not a romance language. it. too bad the bible doesn't have a financial stability plan. :).
}{
I'm getting pretty close to being homeless myself.. i've been very close to that situation myself. Nicki, it does. lol. Nicki, thats why jewish people have all the money ;). I thought it was because they were cheap.

Doretta, same thing ;). old testament > new testament? :). That's what seinfield tells me, atleast. im pretty cheap myself. *want to use. that's why i'm getting my portfolio site up :).

you dont need that. i never did any of that portfoilio resume none of that. of previous work. skate or die ... thats the deal ... skate or die. yor just not talking to them right. well i've been trying those rentacoder sites and pretty much every posting says "show me 3 examples blah blah blah".

my gf is me, but with a vagina.  and she's hot too.. except i haven't switched her over to linux yet.. erinstalent.com. Santo, The Narcisists ?. Santo, is that what the mailbox says ?. no breasts?.
}{
heh. moobs. and facial hair. 10 years. oooooo. she has big boobies!.
}{
i thought you just came over. bwahaha. lol @ "my gf is me with a vagina". i speak perfect irc english. speaking ?. she shaves daily too ? lol.
}{
i'm getting scruffy. fuck why am i not being productive?. is her name RMS by any chance?. no. because theres nothing better than doing nothing. you still cant speak english after 10 years ? Santo.
}{
no, i'm fluent.. i need to ZzzzZzzz. accent ?. yes.  but it's hot.. ?. haha.
}{
i've been told that soo much. nh, accents are hot. i speak perfect native english spanish and portuguese pronounciatio is the key to a language. i think  i will .. she's cordially invited :-). ye. doooooooooooooooooooood.
}{
narly. jeff spicoli is my hero. hell everyone was like "Whoa, you SO have a Cleveland accent" when I moved down to Columbus because they elongate the a's.. anyways i think your jus putting it on ;) 10 years your not romanian your american. actually no, i'm not an american citizen. *them.
}{
that. why not ?. pfft.. you get what i mean. my differential equations TA is romanian. takes 6 years correct ?. and her accent is hot too.
}{
hey! .. we share a pond together .. remember? ;-P. heh. ummmmmmmmm. lol. Santo, you should be deported. lol.
}{
gratifyingly, it's widening.... they can still deport you. you should be exported. citizenship you have rights. why would they deport me?. moving to brazil, you said?.
}{
Santo, not me. did i ever say i was here illegally?. Santo, i never said that. sacrifices some dumbasses to the almighty Mid-Atlantic Ridge ;-). i am a legal brazillian citizen too. :).
}{
but not being a citizen does not give you certain protections. i know. and i would never want to go back to romainia. but it saves me $500 and lots of trip to the government building downtown. i was talking on his sake not mine. i have een people get deported that thought this same thing.
}{
what were they deported for?. hurling them into volcanos is a noble tradition ;). You guys don't seem to understand there's something called a "Permanent Resident Alien". i understand completely. but shit that deals with marriage  n shit. Minneapolis hoes?  Doesn't sound appealing..
}{
doesnt apply the same. 2ndly many people dream to become a citizen and you turn it down. Madison, its a big world man, thats his right. huh?. errerererererer. half way ;).
}{
later. hes eastern europe what can ya expect. thieves liaers and prostitutes. i guesss. my vissa doesn't expire. still marriage rules.
}{
Madison, but 10 years, i would say, he's not telling the whole truth. haha. lol. rot13. thanks. yea.
}{
i came here on a permanent visa. thankfully ;). well, i wouldnt say "america" is a joke, just the current crop of people running it. dont get cocky ..........ive been to romiania remember. did i say romania is better than america?. america is the land, the political system is whats messed up.
}{
political system is fine ........give it 2 years. it happens. carter almost destoyred the country. lol. that is a really good idea. but it would be sure great to come here.
}{
Santo, yeah, well, we got attacked, people panick when they get attacked ... its normal human behavior. lol, thanks. Santo, it'll die down and pass. the government is not supposed to panick. omg. Santo, well, the muslims nutjobs crashed airplanes into the pentagon ... its understandable.
}{
can you even vote ????//. lol. It was staged. The US did it.. keeping beliving it. Yes, it made PERFECT sense to attack Afghanistan.. Okay..
}{
Santo, i dont agree with troops being anywhere ... its stupid. That's the extent of America's foreign policy since 2000.  "Send troops here, get oil.". haha that's great. whats d.o?. europe pwnz.. iraq was a mistake 100 percent.
}{
no worries, the money would have been spent on something equally stupid otherwise. debian.org. like the war on drugs. lol I was messing!. maine is the only american state that has only one syllabal. thanks..
}{
ah ;). jus saying. maine is a peice of shit. i love us government hate current administration well not hate but i think some of thier decision were stupid. Santo, i dont think so. but i also think thsis hardcore liberal left is also to blame.
}{
people like john kerry and al gore aint any better. Ireland is bigger than maine.. not much. your wrong. http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/ may be of use. you're.
}{
your wrong. you're. anyways. not gonna fight. Santo, to an extent you are correct on that one, but allowing people to snort cocaine, get addicted, steal other peoples cars, and shoot each other with guns, all because they are tweaked out and need another line, isnt good. most of america is not bible thumpers.
}{
you're welcome. Santo, its a proven fact that narcotics fuck people and society up. By the same token, allowing someone to gamble, lose all their money, steal a car, and shoot someone, cause they lost all their money isnt good.. Azzie, gambling isnt physically addictive. no, but their whole policy is vastly different so that it actually works. Prove it..
}{
Is caffeine?. Santo, sure, i can buy that. Or sugar?. Santo, they arent much on education and rehabilitation here. The drug policy of the Netherlands is based on 2 principles:. 1. Drug use is a public health issue, not a criminal matter.
}{
2. A distinction between hard drugs and soft drugs exists. destroy families. Azzie, religion is the most dangerous drug of all. that's because the prohibition makes it unaffordable - the gubment sets the price of illegal drugs. Outlaw it?. Horacio, it does not.
}{
Horacio, and noone can afford crack. Drugs is a problem everywhere. be it legal or not. im dooooooone. the actual cost of producing crack is neglibible. i would never drve a truck. Azzie, its a physically addictive drug.
}{
So is caffeine!. yes, people steal to feed the habit.. And are you implying that physically adicting is worse than mentally?. booze is extremely heavily taxed, everywhere. is this a linux channel or a political debate channel?. yes,.
}{
yes. :-). again, the state has artificially inflated the price. both ;-). it degenerates frequently, coincidentally when Arlie has the floor ;). governmen made wealth btw. not the current government..
}{
cigarettes are worse than alcohol. alcohol passifies people....it keeps them sedated. alcohol is good :). ok ?. lol. Support ?'s take priority here, whats up?.
}{
##linux - "all of the noise, none of the signal". I call alcohol a "personality enhancer" :). lol!. because that's what it is. No I am cool man, I had a packer question, but Horacio answered me!. I never said More People = More Wealth.  20 years ago the economy was vastly better than now.
}{
:). now ... pump a gram of meth into someone ... its gonna take 5 people to hold that guy down. umm 80's economy was bad. 90's was good. because meth turns a sickly anemic geek into superman. i meant 90's.
}{
it's almost been 20 years. not yeyt. well. round up. Rachel, yeah ;). Who here thinks drugs should be legalised? :).
}{
its inflation deflation government controlled Santo you need both. me. me too.. and taxed.. econoy sorry. cool :) BEcause they should :).
}{
yeap. guys. drugs should not be legalisez ever. the truth of the matter is, drugs are already legal. death threats?. booze , grass, crack - all legal and taxed (but you keep you fsckn hands OFF MY COFFEE!!! ).
}{
bush does not have the power congress has. i'm not.  i'm saying that his administration made America a laughing stock. the alcohol prohibition was an outstanding success. Gonzales. right - were'd you hear that?. Canada?.
}{
:p. Rep of Ireland. you mean the IRA?. I assume you are being jocose once again. Jamar, swap ?. government takes care of thier people .......thats why its better here .......if you didnt have rule and the kind of security etc there would be widespreadd corruptin and it would be bad.
}{
and cigarettes illegalised. legalize linux!. power causes amnesia. haha!. not to mention the fallen eastern europe. all capitalism countries are crap :).
}{
this is capitalisim. so are most of communist/socialist. truth. the first capitlistic country. death to capitalism. hahahaha.
}{
besides greece. personnally I sway a little to the right myself!. america is not the first capitalist country. all should be anarchy.  anarchy rules.  anarchists of the world, unite.. i jus said greece. communism is a higher level, eveolution.
}{
Jamar, i mean, this is an IDE flash drive ? that plugs into the IDE controller ?. They are destroying it man.. workers... workers of the world unite :). :). obviously you have much to learn :). oatmeal is good.
}{
I love oatmeal... I wasnt joking. I see.. that's life. Jamar, since you want the special filesystem that supports wear levelling on it, and not just whatever is on the IDE drive now. wtf does that?. UK is pretty F*****.
}{
?. does what ?. I like capitalism just fine, I just hate lobbyists and politicians. Ireland. oooo. I gather you lean to the left?.
}{
:P. cool.. does what ?. hopefully it'd be compiled into ubuntu feisty.... left of what?. sorry, never mind, I'm too tired.
}{
hope so havent really looked into ireland. ya really? what part?. political. Sherlene, guess I'll fly into DUB and drive to Co. Cork. s/reate/rate. ireland is fine but its cold :(.
}{
ireland > Madison.location. Ryan Air is cheap, and uses shannon primarily. a one dimensional political spectrum is quite useless IMHO. i know how it is. Sherlene, Ryan doesn't fly trans atlantic. liberalism?.
}{
yep. extreme left will. you need a balance. Sorry, I keep forgeting I am talking to Yanks lol. Sherlene,  :). 'sorry'?.
}{
it's always to the right :). its great. nooo. Carter ???????/. it's basically a one party system. he almost made it part of the soviet union.
}{
*not. well. the country was built on a conservative motive. can you get quickbooks running on linux?. (and Ryan Air has no FC....flight snob here:)  ). so people want to keep it that way obviously.
}{
no.. actually it wasn;t. it was. Jefferson and all of them sound pretty liberal to me. FC!!! nice, economy suits me! student budgets suck!. yeah.. President Halliburton :D. i guess slavery was what ?.
}{
that's the veep. Sherlene, I just have an amazing surplus of frequenty flyer miles :). the real prez is a puppet. treason is punishable by death :). lol. so it would appear.
}{
good the rosemburgs fried too. Sounds like me on evry flight!. Sherlene, I'm a pilot...but only single engine 4 seaters :). really ?. i want to buy a plane. twin engine cessna.
}{
I am a pilot of computers. . . .  yaaa!. the constitution states all men have equal rights no matter coliur, race or religion, right?. no. I fly so much comerically now that I hardly have a chance to stay legal :(. lol. 3/5.
}{
yea. sorry. ireland ==== Cold. Miami ===== Hot. Sherlene, I'm actually drinking a Guinness right now. oh...
}{
I still think capitalism sucks :). Cant bate a pint of plain!. hi. i am   Richie. Sherlene, what cities ? :). kinda good weather south carolina is better though ;).
}{
Madison, I'd have to!. so it would seem.... Location are different, not better.. whats the sucess rate ?. analyse the system.. people with different jobs, have different pays right?. Weather aint bad here.
}{
aggressive war is forbidden by international law. it gets cold. plam trees ?. I don't mean like that. south by far. Sherlene, I was making a bad joke...I'm kinda a country boy myself (at heart) but Dub was so small compaired to Paris or London or even something like Atlanta.
}{
Its geography fact - Oceans moderate temperature.. ireland have plam trees ?. For this reason, south cali fluxuates around 20degrees all year. the whole south of usa is mild. no.. it is a question of ability. coasst never gets cold.
}{
the _differential_ may be excessive, but IMHO it's absurd to suggest they should be paid the same. a street cleaner might not have been BORN intelligent enough to be a surgeon. Allegra, thats not our problem. maybe not the same, but the difference should be minor. that's too bad - that's like saying hideous people have a right to be models. Allegra, he's lucky we had enough money to buy him a truck and pay him to clean the street.
}{
no it's not. no... it's not his fault. he wasn't born intelligent enough to get a better job. Sherlene, I love Kerry!. Allegra, each according to his own abilities ... capitalism allows that.
}{
like I said, I love capitalism...I just hate the politicians and lobbyists. disease!. :). lol. 1666 - plague. greatest invention ever - soap = hygiene.
}{
(and thats not a euphmisim ). the plaque wasnt caused by lack of soap. because we are allinter-dependable. G'luck lads!. Allegra, antibiotics. er..plauge.
}{
not months, years, no cleaner ever... you need to tunnel and forward X. bubonic plague is trivially cured by standard antibiotics these days - amoxycillin does the job quite nicely. still, hygiene is needed :). after a couple of months it doesn't get any worse. it would after a few years.
}{
dogs and rats and crows etc eat it. without using X, is it possible?. you have no idea what you're talking about. not cans, into the street. that's what happens when garbage cans are not emptied. Allegra, where are you from?.
}{
lol. Allegra, its the truth. not enough, is it?. yeah, 8 or 9 once IIRC - like I said, it reaches a level and stays there. Allegra, cool. hows the tax haven of the world?.
}{
whats up wiht you eastern europeans today. ok.. nothing special :/. romania croatia. rats eat aluminium cans? :P. croatia is a part of central europe. wel.
}{
close enough. and we were never part of the soviet union. well. edge right ?. almost all of the rubbish is organic. Allegra, theres something you dont understand when you say you would like to abolish capitalism.
}{
and that is?. you abolish capitalisim we will be eating rice. is eating and organic meal right now....does that help?. not true, communism is the next step :). this whole idiotic discussion arose out of your absurd suggestion that a street cleaner should be paid the same a surgeon. like I said, I love capitalism...I just hate the politicians and lobbyists.
}{
Allegra, communism takes away hope. why the cayman islands ?. and communism provides a standard and equality. because:P. any specific reason ?. Allegra, shame on you.
}{
it makes sense :). I hi. communism is still better. no, raise everybody to the same level. 'equality' cannot be 'provided'. Allegra, you have to force them to be equal.
}{
trying to be clse to Cuba ?. Allegra, its not a natural state of affairs. why not go live there. OH no. Allegra, no, it isnt. you got your facts wrong.
}{
Allegra, fuck you and your community. Allegra, you dont own me. you have a good life. communisim never worked. Allegra, its a really simple system that works quite well. I get some crops.
}{
and you get water. Allegra, thats allowed under capitalism already. /join #politics. to each according to his needs :). it does not wooooooork. no one actually tried it, similarly with capitalism ;).
}{
Allegra, needy people suck. russians ?. Cuba ?. want and need are different things :). lol. I got to go eat dinner :).
}{
no. so bye. peple want to better themselves. capitalism will fail :). there is noting. wow.
}{
only through Roosevelt's leftist policies was America dragged out of the depression. and you cannot deny that :). go back t croatia. Socialism vs. Capitalism debate :) I was wondering when another one of these would happen, this morning.. I got to go now. bye.
}{
yea enjoy your better quality of lfe. i like miami. america was dragged out of the depression with financial reform ... dumb ass. hot girls. (is it wrong to say that?). you ever been to miami Demetrius.
}{
oh yeah. Horacio, i hate communists ;). has traveled a lot. good. yep. Hi,please I need Scanner driver (Benq 5000F), please ,, thank you...
}{
i preffer a little hotter climate. sane.org IIRC. thx friend. I'm wrong, hang on. ok. http://www.sane-project.org/.
}{
Madison, I'm a die hard skier... I've been tempted to move to Colorado...but I'm just not there. ok, thank u. Horacio, i guess. has never skiid, but cant count how much snowboarding. er..everything. i hate snow.
}{
whats the difference b/t a snowboard and a vacuum cleaner?. lol. or were just criminals, like the kennedys *cough* joe kennedy *cough*. Horacio, joe kennedy wasnt a criminal. Yes. Horacio, his father was.
}{
disney world is pretty fun]. havent been since I was 7 :). its fun. jfk and his brother may not have been, but it was mafia money that bought jfk the presidency. i take my girl freidn there. my old one.
}{
Horacio, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy,_Sr.. smells a 4 day weekend soon. heh, wikipedia. anyone gotten secondlife working on x86_64?. its healthy :P. hi, why does backup speed vary when backing up two different partitions to a scsi DAT tape-drive?.
}{
you know whats not? Atlanta...where my office is...yuck!. i never liked the ATL to much. Madison, you aint missing much. right, and he only started importing alcohol after prohibition ended  - hahaha. i tested the begining of the tape the partition is /home @ 850KB/s   any other partition is 1455KB/s. Horacio, he was already rich.
}{
Horacio, according to wikipedia, he bought the importation rights during prohibition. Horacio, a very smart move. Horacio, his kids of course, were pretty much all fuckups ;). you want some hosting :). Madison, i have the worlds fastest webserver software ... i'll pass ;). i was kidding.
}{
huh?. wtf ?. lol. one way is ........ i would assume you would not need it. Madison, just not now.
}{
lol. my $850 hospital bill was slashed to $150 :D. Thanks to Charity Care.. Are you going with my plan? Create the server, post some stats, and offer hosting?. Azzie, no. Well, then..
}{
im going with my plan. lol. Would have never guessed.. Isn't that unrelited.. unrelated*. unrelated to what ? a fast webserver ?.
}{
Yes. Interesting.. internet sales hit $100 billion dollars this year. use sed.. That reminds me, did you go with a seperate i/o thread design?. vga=normal ? I forget.
}{
Hmm.. I'll try that.. nope. maybe video=vga. it will tell you. Azzie, although, i cant say ive tried all potential methods and timed them.
}{
For caches. How did you go about it?. Im referring to the request stress benchmark. response times, rather. parsing http requests ?. Yep.
}{
was 500,000 ... recoded it to 900,000 req/sec. just parsing a simple GET. And they were asyncronous requests?. ah. thats where socket data ends up. Azzie, i tested my code.
}{
Azzie, not kernel code. the kernel is the kernel. I know what youre saying.. Good point.. although, there are a few patches to the kernel that will increase overall throughput, but im not telling you what they are ;). throws MrParanoia into the arena with rabid Redmond weasels.
}{
Azzie, its nothing available already. Azzie, /dev/epoll is old. Von, why are you having issues with accessing email?. Although now its a syscall so i doubt that would help.. you don't need windows to access web based email. Von, use FF and it works fine..
}{
you could also use a client that supports pop3. it doesn't with my isp. wonders why every "non-functional" piece of Open Source software works without flaw on his computer.. and tech support won't talk to me about. Azzie, part of the problem with making a fast webserver, is that your dealing with small files and large files, and you cant treat them the same. Von, get a different ISP..
}{
tech support are idiots. This one ISP helped me trouble shoot kmail :D. i'll try raising some hell with my isp when i get back home. embarq is my isp. Comcast is my isp.. Hrm.
}{
Von, use gmail and googletalk.. Azzie, give me a second. konquerer won't log into any part of myembarq.com. Azzie, http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/WorldCup.html. hi. evening y'all.
}{
hey gregoh. memmy leakage. using firefox?. i never have been impressed by sprint or embarq (an offshoot of sprint) tech support. i think i'll go have a drink. Azzie, plus the traces are screwed up.
}{
Azzie, they are "mostly good" ;). Anyone know of a related utility?. So that's what < does! thanks!.  not really. nope, < and <() are VERY different :). wow.
}{
i have it installed. Has anyone here used MKS integrity?.  ok im here. anyone use elinks with x11 support?. (without the quote). i compiled it with x and color support, but i don't know how to run it with either.
}{
can someone answer a question. is redraw under x a gpu or cpu issue?. please. i though it would be like links with a -g option. s/bos/box. Arlie, you should remember this problem :). Demetrius, what problem ?.
}{
come on. someone has got to know?. THANK YOU.  i got an error. Arlie, remember my encrypted backup dilemma?. i appreciate the answer. thanks. What does "Route 2, PO Box 188" mean?.
}{
I get the PO BOX 188 part. Sharlene, means you are connected to West Virginia. hmm.  i just did now and now the error went away.  now on this user i can run 'reboot' ?. Ah, okay, so they are completely different..

Yes.. If they were not, there would be no reason to have seperate syntax!. Touche.. :). yeah. ok cool.
}{
'startx' runs automatically. good afternoon. I haven't used either, but I have used DSL. wtf does ". fs sa rlidwka" mean. I like IceWM better than Fluxbox.

ahh well that would be a good reason not to use DSL I guess. I haven't used IceWM myself. dwm is the best window manager ever.. I like icewm.. hates all window managers to some extent. Domitila, I empathize with you..

err, the name does not. 1&2 is a totally different thing too. (just adding to the confusion). goldfish it was perfectly proper. I know.. guutgawd o.o.
}{
:-p. Forget it!. i need kitty. Georgia way I understand it, backup-wise, linux files are just windows files without mandatory locking on by default. Would that be correct?. Linux files aren't windows anything..
}{
Yeah.. That confused me.. We're not sure what you're trying to ask, Velda.. Files are files.  They contain binary or ascii data.. Really, I'm asking about backups and locking. , linux files are just windows files without the kangaroo and the banana cream pie..

}{
Melda - oh, simple enough - thanks a lot!. Santo, yes.. Santo, there's a special character than denotes EOF.. Ah, that meant how it read.. Melda - i was trying it that way,a ctually, it just merged it all together. Awesome!  Learn something new every day..

lol.. oh oops. wtf. yeesh,  memtest86+ gives me hundreds of "errors" and going on 2000 "ecc errors".... YourUserName ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL. ?.
}{
I'm just wondering, does most hardware contain a random number generator? does /dev/random use this random number generator?. what does the first error say?. i just rebooted - i don't recall. er clarification pls. mine's 8". what exactly is wrong with the line?.
}{
those high-quality ebay 1GB memory modules. you use 'su'?. /dev/random is not a random number generator.. you gave YourUserName ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL. i think it should be YourUserName ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL. i quit tinkerning about four years ago.
}{
no. Don't you dare suggest that!!! I hate Apple!!!. I want some RAM with a radioactive casing. :D. so it's not the theory of an infinity of random monkeys pounding on random keyboards to eventually recreate all the works of shakespeare?. i mean, one day my /dev/random was the introduction of macbeth.

Melda, it could be. could it really be? :). hi. :). you mean with the three witches?. thats whack.

where are all the good channels. Daryl, a virtual server. Rachel I mean, the algorithm might not be able to generate that. chroot/jail - or a VE ;). my knowledge isn't that great, I think that'd probably be over my head. :(. where there are people.

oh cool.  I like your disable root technique.. errors galore still. anyone?. Gale, microsoft sucks and they smell like cheap cologne !. Lakenya, it might just give you black. it's pretty standard on most "big" servers.

essentially. this is a nvidia network interface driver.. Gale, he gives out bad software with viruses ... bad odor isnt hard to imagine. oh god i have no energy. i have to eat something :(. can anyone help-me with this?.

I was thinking he smelled like bacon. what distro?. opensuse 10.2. probably not. I don't know.. i pulled out a pair of memory modules and no errors yet. Gale, was it brimstone?.
}{
:P. im gonna challenge people to hack my server soon. me!. my actual version is 0.56.. that might have been it. Are you running a BSD, Arlie?.
}{
how can I upgrade a kernel module?. like actually ripped them off the RAM? (or are you talking about something else?). Santo, no ... its a message passing tcp server. I have the new version source.. that weird kind of bacony smell, not the normal bacony smell that makes you hungy, but the kind that makes you want to heave. i took out two of four sticks.
}{
that 10 seconds can mean a big difference! lol. Gale, like a 10 day old chef salad w/ bacon ?. yeah. or maybe mothballs and bacon. I know. aah, winner..

that imitation bacon that isn't Bakos but some strange brand. i want to go to a computer show and shout "your an asshole" when bill gates is speaking. s/hard-to-detect/hard-to-crack/. but thats old news.. Rachel, it would be fun tho. not very constructive tho.

bring a pie. Rachel, no ... thats illegal. oh wow. without their consent. Azzie, im not benchmarking windows. Azzie, im benchmarking my webserver.

Azzie, theres nothing illegal about it. i realize why i have been morbidly depressed all day:  CSS + NO MUSIC + no food today yet. Azzie, nope, nor will i ever. Im sure it rivals most novels. Azzie, use someone elses copy. lol.

awww.  It looks like you have to hack some CSS.  Good luck :-). no, I follow the KISS methodology and refuse to use hacks.. hmmm. and that is a background process.  <!--[if IE]><style type="text/css" media="screen"> /* is your friend! */</style><![endif]-->. ok.......

ubuntu.  although the upgrades between versions can be iffy. there's also debian testing.  or debian unstable.. necesito ayuda en centos pero en espa?ol. the undefined references usually mean an #include or two are missing. or the #include files they refer to. so how should i go about finding out ?.

holas. so thats 1 guaranteed sale ;). and ./configure again. oh ok. :P. switching the memory around to different slots seems to fix the memtest86+ errors.

is it possible the memory just needed to be reseated. ~>. ~>. sounds real n00bish. that jus take s it and installs it. where i it now :P.

hello. did you upgrade yet?. ah. it is installing right now. it has finished downloading the right files. most kind ;).

 apparantly unregistered people can not message you.. first settlement was 400 years ago. That's a pain. Care to register?. spanish were here over 500. not really.. maybe considerably earlier.

where you live ?. Sweden. fuckin a ... 1776 .... declaration of independance. oh, lunatics, ok ;). no one cares about sweden its cold. I try not to judge.. but maybe :D.
}{
heh, i just watched the southpark episode on that declaration.. Blonde blueeyed bisexuall girls on conventions hugging :). so we are talking shared memory. protected access with pthread_mutex_lock etc. conventions ?. boardgaming and stuff. board gaming ?.
}{
Angla, it should be the other way around. 2ndly blonde blue eyed girls are not my thing :P. yhee, like Go, Risk, D&D, live roleplaying and stuff. Use /notice. they actually sound vaguely fun. I like the ones with "hug me" on their chest, I'm just half tempted :D. or "touch me" on the chest :).
}{
At least you're not bashing.. i don't think they will ever allow fuck on tv btw ........its to much of a strong word. Notice the invite.. where?. cartoon central... late-night movies... A&E, tons of junk. lol.
}{
err, comedy central* cartoon network... tons of stations. the word or the act? :). i think its bleeped out some how. granted mostly between 12AM-2AM, but it's definitely out there. like South Park Georgia Movie, age limit 7yo non cencured =D. lol just a second ago it was bleeped on the tonight show ;).
}{
actually on comedy central yea. Angla, i think so, and i think its still one of the fastest. Angla, ibm apparently owns it now. mmt. mm. yes, but french are all fags so it doesn't affect them :-p.
}{
just not during the day, and not over the broadcast airwaves. most of europe is that way. gentlemen please, i'm spluttering into my rioja. lol. im jus saying. anyone here good with icecast?.
}{
lol. ?. fuking serious ?. "look ! its micket mouse and a homosexual couple". er..mickey. huh ?.
}{
wow. It never has real sex.. oh my god - not homosexuals! oh noes!. .... It never shows good old penetration. channel 4 does, however, have Scrapheap, and thus is very important..
}{
they show sex on UK tv ?????/. channel 4 rocks.. It's illegal by UK laws to show an erect penis or something.. It's rubbish.. (on TV). wow.
}{
titties and pussy ?. cool :). Yea, sometimes.. BBC3 had "Teenage Tranny" on the other day. I think it may actually be legal to show an erect penis on non standard channels (ie, PPV). But stuff like Channel 4 that everyone can get without restriction, they're not allowed to..
}{
titties and pusssy ?. yeap, we're allowed that.. not hard ones, no. wow. of course, they have shown strap-on cocks uncensored.... thats crazy.
}{
stilll. cause they can show non erect penises and stuff.. reallly weird. europe sent most of it's thumping puritans to the 'new world' ;). I have fond memories of "Amsterdam: City of Sin". Melda, and the whole world is discriminating ... theres nothing wrong with being discriminating.
}{
it does not, not even "civil union" are technically allowed, but having a homosexual governor that may change. did you get a hooker there ?. Melda, its a disney world public ceremony ... i never claimed it was legal ... but its still a marriage. and. no - PREROUTING. nah, they hookers probably all have HIV or AIDS or something..
}{
But there was a whole Channel 4 TV series about it when I was younger.. Horacio, whats the diference?. I remember watching it and thinking "Hell yea!". one works ;). ?. lol.
}{
Melda, your missing the point. society is falling apart. society has always been falling apart - just like how we're all constantly dying - one of those perpetual things ;). Melda, sure, and thats why i said, given time, we'll be saying fuck and watching titties on broadcast tv. Melda, no, its discrimination against horny naked people. anyways.
}{
Melda, i know full well what discrimination is. go rent "idiocracy" - you'd enjoy it i believe - the movie agrees with your theories ;). now it's everywhere on TV.. "worker threads of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your iptables". Melda, i dont think you understand. Horacio, will this really work?.
}{
(I have no idea what we're talking about though). fuck i a very strong word im america. It's still a strong word here.. it's like "liberal". totally taboo on fox. well i dont want my 5 year old yellling or hearing fuck. Melda, they dont like your behavior, so they have you removed.
}{
honestly, I wouldn't either.. hell never had the effect of fuck. gibs0n?. grc.com. Melda, because it turns a kids park, into fag heaven. except french accordion music.
}{
and two men holding hands won't scar your children anymore than hearing your ignorant views on the world. Melda, they arent ignorant. precisely. Melda, they are simply heterosexual and family oriented. the 'shields up!!!' thing - https://grc.com/x/portprobe=6879. lol.
}{
yea, me neither. Context I suppose. If there was something educational with mild nudity, I don't care. Love scenes, or sex, I'd rather not :). tnx. what ?. Angla, no i wouldnt ;). lol, have fun then, you better get off this internet thing too - i hear there's a lot of homosexuals and free-thinkers out there on it - you may accidentally run into someone that doesn't completely agree with censorship and the classical right-wing judao-christian views. Doesn't mean it's cool, just... I don't think people need to sue because they're emotionally scarred..
}{
that's a fair point :). I didn't mean you specifically. Melda, no, just fags like you. my wife, fyi: erinstalent.com. dumb animals. Is there a way to get a memory dump of 0xF0000000?.
}{
me and you are the only normal ones here. Melda, you'll be blowing smith and wesson. lol. so how unreliable is nfs?. hahahah. mmk lkiddo.
}{
 worried your kids might be exposed to the real world, options that might consider, and things many millions of people do?. this is not the real world. what's not real? irc? say it's not so!. s. heh. heh.
}{
and they appreciat eyou staying the fuck away. Melda, gladly. 90 percent of these irc people are deprived far left wing indiiduals ......... i thought we already established this ??. anyone here good with icecast?. 'service'?. Rebekah, gParted, or QTparted.
}{
Horacio, yes, some daemon.... no. ok tks. it should Just Work(tm). cant be serious. WTF the is the world coming toooooo.
}{
public sex. i dont give a fuck what anyone saus ....... a 4 year old seeing someone give a blow job WILLL affect them. interesting imagery .... you have some research to back this up?. or is it just 'obvious'. so we just expose 5 and 6 year olds to public sex ????.
}{
cant be serious. you're right, it might affect that 4 year old...  he/she might grow up with an awareness of the world, his/her own sexuality, realistic body images, and all sorts of horrible things we couldn't possibly allow.. I didn't say that - I questioned your assertion about the effect of seeing such a thing. .............yall are reallly freaking wierd. glad your not parenting my kids. presents the channel with a penis-shaped yule log.  Dig in..
}{
so you would allow your 5 year old to be exposed to sex ?. Horacio, it hasnt worked.... I think we're mixing issues a little overall. answer ^^. is there a linux distro that handles 3d desktops better than other?. no, it's a question of video card and driver.
}{
no. they are all nonsense. are you all athesit toooooo ?. st. I cannot seem to be able to resize a NTFS partition via qtparted. its disabled. oops. i meant Selina.
}{
^^^. heh.  ok, please explain how it will be very bad.. its just not right. lol whats nonsense, 3d desktops or linux :). not children.
}{
What's the appropriate age?. thats not children. 3d desktops. beryl the peril. compiz. vista. osx aqua. phooey. i continued the habit into adulthood tho. yes.  that's why their bodies don't perform sexual functions yet.  Being fully aware of sex, its responsibilies, sexuality, etc, before their body reaches that stage, will prevent a lot of later problems.. wtf.
}{
undubitably. i think its same effect. i dont even want to know how this convo started :). undubitably? I have no idea what that is. a contronym?. indubitably.
}{
fdfdfdsfads. im out you people are to much. you are not a native english speaker?. I speak Minnesotan.. well. exactly far left liberal.
}{
cause i ddint. hehe. does that mean you can speak no language? ;). im not liberal your right. I was just curious of undubitably was an antonym of indubitably.. hello.
}{
children should also be taught about the responsibilies and risks of sex, not just the physical aspects.. Calista ol?, hauahuah. i have   inspiron 6400. dell. laptop. im  using  debian.
}{
someone's got a broken space bar?. most sex education is completely and totally worthless.... absolutely. and it's still way too hard to get birth control. can u  hellp me?. kde.
}{
probably depends on whether it responds to HUP. well im hitting the bed now, nighty.  cyas. try editing your xorg.conf to the native resolution of the lcd. I don't know :P. thank you.
}{
that's fine, it's not a 'well known' port. Crissy/Thurman "&" and nohup, bg, screen etc all have limitations. but you can generally get something going. you got 'stealth', 'close', or 'open' ?. steath. arrgghh. Horacio, and azureus is running.
}{
public* :). *shudder*. ??. pastebin the output of 'iptables -t nat -L'. and I wouldn't proclaim to have all the answers. I don't.. yeah.
}{
I can't argue and say "no they wouldn't" anyway, and I wouldn't argue that. YOu might be right, I honestly don't know :). and a browser. the ubuntu 7.04 kernel needs a bit of an overhaul, but they are 95% there. Horacio, http://pastebin.ca/506717. *snarf*. I am going back to edgy.

well.... Horacio, i too have another problem here... http://img384.imageshack.us/my.php?image=20070524013155oj1.png (a second gateway). :\. Horacio, win XP. plus Ill be building my own kernel on ubuntu. maybe I should go with the new one.

is so glad he has a /home partition lol. oh, no - sorry, I'm too tired to get into this now. ohh, ok. *snort*. Horacio, its a suse linux too. plus the gentoo channel banned me today.
}{
ok. I really with I could use debain, but the unstable versions take to long. twice. hmm. Horacio, its a order number?. Horacio, tnx.
}{
Horacio, good night. you're welcome. debian or ubuntu or what ?. the thing is, xorg 7.0 was unstable. right. and I was using FreeX86 or what ever.
}{
but I wanted to use Xorg, because its what I always have used. so I tried setting it up, and could not get it to work correctly on debain. What is the most featureful CLI web browser?. Jenae try links2 and w3m. I agree. waht's debian deficient in, update speed?.

What about Elinks?. yeah. Jenae haven't tried it. anyone know of a safe way to remove the paint/dye on the keys of a keyboard?. vitamin u. heh.
}{
yeah. like slackware. chkconfig is ok. slackware will be fine when they realise that 2.4 kernel is past the point of usefulness. ducks. yeah, but I think ubuntu is a good, stable, apt/deb based distro.  that has a lot of support and stuff.

and I think all the other distros hate it because its so successful. ducks. beryl?. expential ?. 'expential'? does that mean 'broken'?. experimental.

and I agree, a vital implement. Blondell, congratulations =). i should have access to the website.. it's strange it's not prompting me with 401. I'll try emptying any cache i have. bugger, now the mist is too thick. im sure the nx program on the linux box has pleny of configuration.
}{
yep. quite right. oh no, not myspace.. can't have that.. Lillie : leads me to my next question .... not trying to, were actually.
}{
isn't that one of those p?dophile sites?. <-- windows uers. user. instantaneous. we like that. see? i've proven my theory about 'newer'software versions already ..lol. Blondell, isn't very hard.
}{
sucking can be a quite pleasurable behaviour ;-). hey travis. heh. hello. Blondell, you'll want to use samba. and friends.
}{
bossa nova etc. i forget the name of the pam library that links AD to linux. Another thing links2 does very quickly and it's just one click away .. (or two key presses). hello. kerberos too eh ?. yeah.
}{
im not a registered user onthis network. i cant version. registers Blondell with the DHS. VERSION GordChat 2.01. Angla you are such a hax0r. Blondell, http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/domain-member.html.
}{
there you go. hey .. i think Renee forget their pants ..lol. anyone know why my screen twitches when my computer is speeding up?. lol ... there's a few tools you use to cross-map accounts. tourette syndrome?.
}{
*there are. i just cant think right now :/. erm .. 02:16 ish here. tourette syndrome?. I'm going to bed. and keeps doing that.
}{
is  it my card or my motherboard or my chip?. or ram?. awhbfaf. no ways im buying a new system. could be the video ram. are you on ubuntu 7.04 ?.
}{
not on the download page... is there a way I can give a certain user access to certain commands (yes). nope. an issue?. Francie someone said that... Sry bout that afk.
}{
Myrtis, yes, me. aight im out. Myrtis, sorry. i meant to specify with sudo. that i know. i want to know how to configure the no password part. hi. Carita using any other program that does what you want. has anyone experience with linux-ha (heartbeat) and nfs? especially when mounting the ha-nfs to the active and the passive server?.
}{
and this is feisty-kernel-specific? and affects pure 32 bit?. sysreq key. or telepathy. Carita so you want something like a shell without a shell program?. Angla sysreg key?. interesting, thanks - I might try a vanilla kernel on my ubuntu-using friend's box, he's complained about it since he upgraded - he was happy with etch. heh.
}{
i want to know how people controlled unix before the first shell was created. :). i'd assume they wrote a shell.. with C code ;). Ubuntu sux. gentoo ?. Debian Etch.
}{
UBUNTU < WINDOWS 95. it's not tardsday again already, is it?. did you ever experience syslog-ng stopping after being reloaded though?. or any "similar" behaviour?. no i didn't. but i switched back to vanilla syslog. so maybe i jumped ship before it got me :). Myrtis Arlie Angla :).
}{
haha. adds a rare ugly hack. i hate ugly hacks. and Ubuntu is < the first copy of windows. ever made. why is ubuntu so "bad"?.
}{
and shoulda stuck to windows. screw that!. forget windows. it's garbage. stick to GNU/Linux. you sure?. I like the lesss viruses. lol.
}{
but I hate its compatiobility with my card. compatibility. hahah. 6600 nvidia OC. 244 damn. Threaded i/o on a asynchronous server is an ugle hack.
}{
:-). Vista works ontop of windows?. i bet they were all korean tourists. or separate. I think ballmer would throw a chair on the other side of the room than have that happen. general intel graphics chips are well supported.
}{
ubuntu 7.04. ^^. general?. !. you gotta be joking. thanks.
}{
thats ultimate lag. the uplink ports are already crossed inside. Come again?. swap's only used when it's needed. or is it just that the extra swap will be idle?. so no, having way too much swap space won't affect performance.
}{
Idaknow, but it's plugged into my laptop's cat5 jack and the other machine's cat5 jack and I'm not getting a response on ping.. is each machine on the same subnet?. Hm, I guess I should activate eth0.. hahah yeah. sorry to create confusion, i want to know about the version of my glibc(which is installed), I am using Ubuntu 7.04. thanks...:).
}{
np. mm. anyone know how to backup ipod files to regular names? or perhaps have a handy-dandy scripty lying around that could rename them to the id3 tag title names?. when will Ubuntus drivers get updated?. Ask on #ubuntu?. oh. well it's 2.5.something. so you are ok.
}{
morning Angla. I just need to check my self, and moreover I am querious, how to check the version of glibc. what's the best filesystem to use on an *nix?. moring squire. hi. ohk :).
}{
is it possible to repair that without reinstalkling ?. hello room. thanks buddy :). i have a question. i have many. i'm using reiser3 and i'm very happy with it.
}{
got no ups, lots of power failures. what is the state capital of idaho ?. Potato, Idaho. probably not. just restore the backup copies you made. "real easy to configure" probably points to lack of knowledge/motivation. Angla, Boise ?.
}{
hello Arlie. morning Malik. gives Arlie extra banana rations. heh. cheater :). dam straight.
}{
Angla, the problem is that I have no backup. http://www.geocities.com/troll_linux_os_2006/troll_linux_os_2006.html. you surprise me. :P. always keep a backup of root. i say.
}{
Angla, I made it quickly without thinking.... really. <------- cheated on girlfriends, cheated on school/ cheated on taxes<----------is a cheater,,<-------- honest cheater, just upfront. so backing up your configs etc. is a very small task. you know.
}{
:p. Hm, anybody familiar with cclinux?. Rodney, better to keep whole /home on different partition. Moin!. er..irs. irc too ;).
}{
amen :P. ooooh. Angla, Audry I overwrited just /etc. good plan. .... NOT.
}{
I am testing dpkg-reconfigure --all but all is broken. so I guess I have to reinstall all. Horacio, !. OMFG. MY MOUSE. SHIT.
}{
"easy" and "full featured" are general and very subjective terms. sure. the people here are very helpful. friendly. and some of them will bend over backwards to accommodate you (ouch !). but lameness and rudeness don't sit together well. Ana, you stole my mouse!. ftp, apache, mail, firewall, dns. any standard distro will get you there. the popular ones are fedora, debian, ubuntu, suse. they all have good and bad points, and they all will take a steep learning curve.
}{
wwi gong to do.... wait, what?. oh yeah. Ana, don't bother then, I couldn't get the stupid postfix thing to work. Ana, ftp, never tried. i'm download ubuntu server right now.
}{
If i'm installing something that refers to the common folder. is that just where it is now?. god knows. Doug, folders? no. directories, yes.. and samba has a web gui. called swat.
}{
how old are you?. i'm 36. lol, 36?. #@$! you have to purchase the pthreads api!?. you think like a silly 12-year kid, no offense meat :). lol.
}{
s/meat/meant/. lol, im australian. i was born 10 years before the unix epoch began. so i moved to australia and got married 1 yr later. Ana, did she come over there or did you come over here?. Ana, ah :).
}{
You sure its an Ubuntu driver problem?. canadian ? my wife is canadian. hi all whenever i logon to irc using centericq  it shows cannot connect u r banned but when i use some client i GUI i can connect. can someone guide me regarding this matter. What is pam?. wht?.
}{
Psomthing Authentication Modules. I need to authenitcate an installation using it.... or something like that. PAM is good. whats the differnece?. hey has anyone here had any success installing a digium tdm400p card?.
}{
can someone guide me regarding this matter. windows is the best and worst. Youre on crack.. partly. hi all whenever i logon to irc using centericq  it shows cannot connect u r banned but when i use some client i GUI i can connect. I shoulda stuck to Windows and the viruses.
}{
had a much better chance. strange :(.  use gaim or pidgen. u mean it cannot connect to irc. the prog ses i just need the pam headers. whoa.
}{
nxserver is awesome. anyone installed asterisk here?. Albertina, asterisk is old, use trixbox. Doug you might consider upgrading to a newer version of your distro that uses pam, although it IS possible to mix pam and non-pam. yeah only thing is I want to keep my OS. Francie, I don't want to blow away my OS that is.
}{
is it a v16 twin-carb ?. Say, where does one get rot13 from? Is that included with something else?. oops Angla I mean :). hahaha. rot13*. ?.
}{
is it a pci phone ?. thanks Myrtis (bugger). thanks. Myrl neither, but owner comes first. Horacio, it's Horacio :D. why would you use rot anything ?.
}{
to encrypt important data, Arlie. duh. oh .. right .. silly me ;). does rot13 wrap around when you get to ascii 127 ?. um, ok. but it obiously must wrap.
}{
Albertina i'd suspect a physical problem first, usually what it ends up bieng. Malik ,Angla: i can enter that directory but cant create/modify files inside it. it's a faster algorithm too, Arlie. are you sure you added the user to the group correctly?. im such a retard ;). perhaps i'll use it on unix socket and shared memory links ;).
}{
thanks Myrtis I think you're right... I've tried 2 machines now.... hm, debian doesn't even come installed with glx gears. yep. :P. 0.o. k :P.
}{
Myrtis, but mesa is software based 3D stuff. http://www.davesplanet.net/store/. hey Ana :D. Myrtis, I want the one that uses nvidia graphics card. k. Lona, putty.
}{
um. getting debian soon \o/. giving up on puppy?. Lona, you might consider trying nomachine. nomachine?>. what does it do?>.
}{
I remember it working. oh well, never use it anyway. lol. I know.. what i don't know, maybe commodore 64 language. LOL.
}{
Ana, you mean BASIC? :P. debian isn't full featured now?. lol. 6510 assembler. lolol. wow.
}{
hehe. it all depends how big that window is ..... liar. XD. great minds, and all that .... Myrtis, thats all i get ... about 3000.
}{
nice..  i was a 10yr old with a c-64 , shit i hardly had a life. lolololol. but i didnt buy the nicest nvidia card ... i bought the cheapest dual monitor one. pfft. sounds like my predicament..
}{
$600: 1000MP stills camera or medium quality handycam?. Ana, here I am, a 16 year old, with a 2.6ghz comp, wishing I had a c-64 XD. lolol. i'm getting 28000 fps with a 1-pixel square window. 450 fps. roflmao.
}{
um. WHAT!?. anyone here experienced with compiling a kernel?. LFS?. i am trying to compile the 2.6.21. lmfao.
}{
one or two. shoot. Cathi yes, why. one thing: nomachine does not work very well with 3D stuff lol. well. duh, Francie =p. I doubt I'll be playing Doom 128 on this 233Mhz box xD.
}{
i've never tried that. Lona, what about doom2? :P. ROFLMAO. lolololol. Cathi why are you using patches?. http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=12414&start=15.
}{
what's that?. maybe he just gave up smoking. bastards Francie. all Linuxes can be made into that.. oh.. I prefer a ready to go version.
}{
ah I see.. there's tons of patches. normally you use them when you need something... whoopeee!!. Myrtis i dunno. Myrtis, but nomachine x is a totally different desgin concept to VNC i think. =p.
}{
lol are you sure?. :D. there must be some reason. is that what you wanted Lona?. no, but neither are you, so don't use it. Lona, and press ctrl + alt + f8.
}{
Lona, oh lawl. don't just use random patches without a need. :D. :(. wtf with this flood of wintendo morons?. no, Cygwin on Win32..
}{
xD. why the hell am I sitting here chatting on irc when Im sposed to be doing h/w ?. nicobrevn?. whats that. call the ops, ask them to ban you :P. I agree..
}{
why are you talkin about windows. i disagree. Cathi http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/. vmware \o/. Cathi -ck patches. windows must be boycotted.
}{
why would you need to run native linux apps on windows. Felicia O_o. Hate Linux? That's crazy talk.. Felicia, what's wrong with drinking coffee?. heh... incompetance*.
}{
heh. Myrtis, lol. it's incompetence btw. stabs Angla under his vest with a pen. all good points. Angla he's a alive I think :).
}{
no. it's very strange. oh but. :D. implmenting unix API on winderz would be hardx. wtf there I go again. go away irc.
}{
roflmao. that's that wifi hackeryjackery thing. kismet?. no it isn't. i know :(. kismet is the ultimate wireless scanning/survey tool.
}{
777 is much better than 666 :D. ROFLMAO. 700 wins. why?. ?. uh oh.
}{
can't run anything!. no files O_O. lawl. teh pointz :D. most kiosks i've acutally seen are NOT touchscreen, that's odd :). toughed =tooked.
}{
tooked=took. rofl @ Angla. really?. no. Beatriz arguably, yes... man, I R learning Linux! Please donna confusa me!.
}{
what ? i thought it was 4095. Beatriz two fingers, like a mac. or. How about dragging something?. "you don't. easy.
}{
Angla, f = 0, so logically fff = 000. or just drak. drag. hm. Francie, is that why people say f off ?. I can confirm that with all touchscreen laptops I've used..
}{
true, me too.. because its 0 ?. Arlie, people say f off because they don't want to say fuck because fuck is too rude. *grin*. Francie, now your just being rude. sets channel mode ##linux +o Lona.
}{
;). Angla, I thought f was 0? or is there a difference between f and F?. sets channel mode ##linux +b Francie!*@*. sets channel mode ##linux -o Lona. there.. Francie, its 15.
}{
Felicia has had Felicia! :D. ....89 ... A = 10, B = 11 ... F = 15. I never got that part about banning someone based on nickname.. i get it now!. roflmao. Francie, its base 16 math.
}{
Hexagamadecimal.. Arlie, I don't know how to use base 16. html uses base 15, didn't you know ?. does \o/. k. <----is whipped.
}{
I see.. I like base 10 the best, because with based 10 you simply increment the numbers step by step. <---- is bored. I thought html used base 128. moin. 1 2 3 4.
}{
Any base works like that, Francie.. 0 1 10 11 100 101, etc.. pfft. Beatriz, no, that's incrementing different. Beatriz, no, that's incrementing differently. Nope..

0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 :D. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b .... :S. can decode 4-digit binary, btw :D. hmm. would like someone to try him XD.

Honestly, that's nothing to brag about. :-P It's very simple math.. 1111111111111111111111111111111011111111111111111111111111111111111. true.. O_O  06:12:27 | * Lona can decode 4-digit binary, btw :D. Lona, 0010 0101 1010. Lona, decode that :).

LOL. ?. well, whatever, you'll figure it out. okay.. it's a joke XD. oh.
}{
will figure it out.. Myrtis, 7-7-6-8-6-1-7-4-2-0-7-6-6-1-7-9-2-0-7-4-6-8-6-9-7-3. Lona what say this?. does that count?. Francisco put the public key on any computers you want to have access to. LOL.
}{
Myrtis, does what say this? count?. there are plenty of documentation about this!. Spread the public key wide!. okay, so my skills are kinda not down pat.. Myrtis, hrm, how does four digit binary to alaphabet conversion work?. i'm not converting to base 3.
}{
Francie I think I did it improperly, but you seemed to understand anyway so it must be a valid communication format. but I did one day draw out the schemetic of a calculator (just the half adder of one) and actually run a number through it :D. LOL. Francie, it doesn't, you can only get 16 characters. Myrtis, but the ? actually looked like this: �. Francie I didn't have a ?.
}{
Myrtis, you decode 0111 0111 0110 1000 0110 0001 0111 0100 0010 0000 0111 0011 0110 0001 0111 1001 0010 0000 0111 0100 0110 1000 0110 1001 0111 0011 using http://nickciske.com/tools/binary.php. Could be a bad SSH setting. Google knows a lot of this (I know, I've had the same problem before.) Go google it.. Francie "what say this". no weird character. Francie, thats 8-bit. converts everythign to 9.81meters/sec?.
}{
-_-. 06:19:19 | <Myrtis> no weird character. oops. Lona, font map. Beatriz, well its extended-ASCII, it is 8-bit. Myrtis, yeah yeah yeah but what is the binary representation of each alphabetical character, where is the list?.
}{
oh.. hi peeps. "Extended ASCII" is so undefined it hurts.. pfft. (on google.). Lona, a numberical index into an array of character bitmaps or font description.
}{
er..numerical. but prob is folder is called $id. Georgia ISO-8859-x series, e.g., can be considered "Extended ASCII"... even UTF-8 can be considered "Extended ASCII".. yeah :/. and i cant seem to get rid of it. any suggestion?.
}{
Beatriz, meh i like to use this -> http://www.asciitable.com/. especially the -r and -R keys. welll! I use my own table I wrote myself :D. I don't like to use a table. makes irc a lot faster. that work?.
}{
i am on a laptop. why is that bad?. oh. Maxwell um, dd?. does it improve performance?. Cathi, it should.
}{
crap. not really... but it stops you running out of RAM. Maxwell use math. *512. you have to tell it about them, but it can. yes, i guess.
}{
but I mean like a teacher. 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111. anyway. okay tell me this, is this usually enabled default?. Darlena, ha ha, very funny. what about the binary system?.
}{
yeah\\. Shenika, how it increments!. gahh. ikernel try wikipedia. dinner! bbs. Darlena, Donna though.
}{
Francie yes, I am. how about Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks) (NO_HZ). Cathi I suspect some programs wouldn't like that. it has no by default. basically it's like decimal, only instead of counting up to 9 before carrying to the next digit, you count to 1. i will go with it i guess.
}{
High Resolution Timer Support (HIGH_RES_TIMERS) ?. Cathi http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=651&num=1. Francie that's because there isn't one, maybe ?. Shenika, I don't ge3t it. kevin`, doesnt sound worth it. also, i dont have smp i bleive.
}{
unless a centrino core solo does. but i doubt it. core solo means one core right?. so it wouldn't be smp. Shenika, no. scheise - have a meeting.
}{
laters - and thanks. Shenika, um, dunno. I think I get it now. 0, 1, 01, 00, 010. is that right?. erm, no....
}{
don't know, that's what im asking :P. the first two are correct :p. 01 = 0 btw. Francie, -> 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111. are you trying to count?. 01 == 1.
}{
01 != 0. kevin` http://pastebin.ca/506901. 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111. remember, the lowest (least significant) digit is on the right, not the left. i mean. base 2.
}{
512mb. Cathi go with the default. 1000 is 8, 1001 is 9.. choice 1. ?. Beatriz, ... oh yeah.
}{
and 1010 is 10 because 8 +2 is 10.. instead of 9. Georgia easiest way I think is to think of each digit twice the worth of the former.. i cant figure out how to count either. Shenika, 002 :P. my monkey fingers screw me all up.
}{
so 1=1, 10=2, 11=1+2=3, 100=4, 101=4+1=5, 110=4+2=6, etc.. Shenika, 000 :D. 100000000000000000000 = 2^20. Shenika, 010. any ideas on what frequency i should run at?. default is 1000hertz.
}{
now increment again. Cathi, 1000hertix. Shenika, 011. but i hear that something like 100-250hz save battery. and again. Shenika, 111.
}{
Shenika, ... 1101?. its a intel centrino chipset, core solo, 2ghz i thinkl. no. You have to carry twice. what about this: 0(10) = 0(2) = 0, 1(10) = 1(2) = 1 * 2^0,  2(10) = 10(2) = 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0, 3(10) = 11(2) = 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^ 0. can you understand it this way?. Malik, nope.
}{
brb dinner. Felicia, i was thinking that, sounds like it might increase my battery life. sure ... you repleied too fast, you didn't try to understand, because you can't think so fast :). someone said that 1k can decrease battery life by half. s/repleied/replayed/.
}{
pfft. *replied is correct i guess. why not use base36 anyways ..lol screw this base2 crap ;-P. too late :p. arg. Cathi see, this is why you use menuconfig.
}{
should never be a real DJ. kevin, im using xconfig. hey, i since ubuntu/debian is .deb based, and fedora/redhat is .rpm based, what is openSuse/NovelSuse use?. Cathi so why is it too lat? :). how about this,  Procfs interface (deprecated) (ACPI_PROCFS). mousedev is deprecated, use psmouse.

Have you got it yet?. ewww. Removable Drive Bay (EXPERIMENTAL) (ACPI_BAY) [N/m/?]. i dunno wtf that means. you have my condolensces. I'm following a guide to have 2 finger scrolling and such on my mac.

so I nee that. My kernel version is 2.6.18. Gricelda, what Mac? an Intel MB/MBP?. oh .. hehe macintel .. ya know , the one Apple embraced after YEARS of bashing intel compared to PPC cpus .. lol. Mark, mbp. I'm following the guide on gentoo wiki.

heh. drools. enjoys. :D. haha. everyones happy.

not happy. satisfied i guess :P. Myrtis, where is that?. isn't happy. I have to fire someone today. Hi, just a few question.

yeah, damn slacker  ;). How can I tag a packet with a VLAN ID on linux?. automatix messed it up hugh. Hoa, hey! i use slackware!. hehe. Wilburn vconfig.
}{
gives Malik a pay raise. :|. lol, that won't happen. we actually have a work IRC channel. means we don't interrupt each other when we're concentrating. good.

hehe. ?. yeh. Cathi you have a pc, I belive, yes?. is a noob. you can hit '?' on each item.
}{
yeh the ? on this one was a little confusin. s/it gets/it gives/. well it says its what all normal pc's use. anything that will always be used you should build into the kernel. this is rediculous. hrm.

is there a linux warez scene?. lol.

WHERE CAN I GET AN UBUNTU CDKEY PM THX. slaps kevin. 10010100101011001011100000011010 Francie. @ikernel. hm. Myrtis, now explain to me what makes that 32 bit :D.
}{
Francie the sequence "32 bit binary" does not resolve to anything. Francie we;;, there are 32 bits. it has 32 bits. that's it. rofl. I see..
}{
I really, really doubt this. damn. so my 32 bit processor... how fast can it process 32 bits?. Francie how fast does it run?. Francie faster than you, obviously. 2.6ghz.
}{
Francie define "process". Darlena, duh, it's a computer. Darlena, you run a string of electrical processes through a processer, and it does stuff. Francie erm.. not even close, no. bitchslaps everyone with his 800 mhz pentium 3. Darlena, not electrical processers, sorry.
}{
Darlena, electrical signals. bicthslaps everybody still standing with his b0rken dual core 2GHz. Ubuntu cdkey? wtf?. Darlena how long does it take a processor to .. hmm, add two 32bit numbers. Shenika, he was kidding. binary logic is represented quite easily by electrical signals.
}{
:S. perhaps it is possibly best not to try learning this stuff. it will not be useful to me anyway. what are you trying to learn?. Caren, im not exactly sure how to describe that :P. should've made a better core system than binary. Myrtis, well, you don't use electrical signals, you use light signals.
}{
uurrgghh, no. hello guys. Francie why?. *edit*?. isn't that read-only ?. Myrtis, there is only so much bandwidth that silicon can take, thus limiting computing power.
}{
infinite reasons. you should just recreate it. emacs/vim. urgh. my stomach hurts like hell. i have the ubunt 7.04 iso.
}{
*ubuntu. however.... and i recreate the iso. i loose the bootable part. that's what i'm asking. maybe they don't have a -.

you get the idea though. and of course you need the boot image itself. lol. i don't know who's rossie o'donnell. you're better off. ;).

yeah check that file, that's where you specify the min or max length, and other various options. thanks. Toya, what?. ideally the directories would also be created. not sure how that would work. could you provide an example.

i would think there are no limits.. DIR=$(sed -ne "s:^FIRMWARE_DIR=\([^, ]*\).*:\1:p" \. and /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent. well, I run a load testing suite against my web server and it errors with 'ran out of threads'  the maximum available are 380.. sometimes the number is a little higher or a little lower. /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max.
}{
when you say load testing, tests on how many connections to the web server?. ok, /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max shows 16380. 1000 concurrent connections. is my goal.. ok, that's easy.. (this is why /proc is delicious).
}{
does anyone know what this does DIR=$(sed -ne "s:^FIRMWARE_DIR=\([^, ]*\).*:\1:p" /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent). because it's accessing a DB.. yeah, but this isn't exactly a web forum :-). just curious about the idea.. Basic sed.. so shouldn't it be against the DB instead of the web server?.
}{
or maybe it's just using the web server.. comes w/ a little xmlrpc server that monitors memory , network etc. My -default- max load is 128,000 threads and I have no idea what the effective web load would be.. ah, keyword, default.. In practice the max load would be determined both by thread-max and how well the system can keep up with the perofrmance demands.. yeh, but shouldnt it?.
}{
presumable, your setup docs should have information about installing or creating it.. maybe you could change your max load and rerun the test.. hi. anyone knows where the postfix name server configs are?. i've got a problem with friend's HDD. can I flood 12 lines?.

with codegen 300W PSU. IDE. lkm = loadable kernel modules. are you sure you have the jumpers right?  also try putting it on its own cable, not shared with another drive.. it is on his own cable. raid sec master. jumpers are OK.

anonymous checkouts?. that's not a good option. svn uses PAM. i'm lost.. try it on a different controller card, with a different cable.... local.google.com.

Hermina, myspace uses cold fusion. really.  'cause it seems kinda hot what they do.. amazing that it even works sometimes, considering.... yah really.  i mean millions.. they need to rewrite the whole damn thing. indeed.

there is a good idea. you mean it has its downside.. myspace's problem is they exist.. lol. cold fusion?. omg..

zope rocks!. s/navt/Navy. I would imagine trying to resize something like a desktop would be very, very ugly.. why is that a bad idea?. cursor position becomes ambiguous.. language choice generally isn't were problems arrise, it's the programmers.

Hermina i have no idea whats even on those paritions, i cant access them with XP. refer to Fallon.. thing = this*. just be VERY careful with the partition you select.  One wrong character or number, and you'll be VERY sorry :-(. um.. illl be using qparted to partition. is that ok Fallon ?.

k. i like stuff with GUI since I noob. :D. Belia dell. Belia is it ok to get rid of one of them?. i don't recommend using gnomes gparted, only kdes qtparted..

the number.  it's very high.. Rickey, ipw3945d is a daemon, not a module, just ipw3945. try with just ipw3945. ?. Fallon, well it could be that it is essential, but I prefer it to stay the heck out of my storage space :P. Belia im lazy so i think ill take my chances with luck.
}{
hehe, you're not the only one.  I don't even use a desktop, it's unnecessary bloat.  A good WM does the job.. ugh. still didnt work guys. Belia, ok i just installing the tool. what you trying to do?. enoload the ipw3945 during boot.
}{
Hermina, well maybe linux/unix/opensource has an answer. :). has hiccups.. Rickey, I can't believe ubuntu is so manual... On debian a few commands would give you a workable wlan interface on boot without any mess with /etc/modules... Are you sure you're doing it the ubuntu(tm) way?. kth, i just compiled this kernel. Rickey, are you using module-assistant? Or did you compile it by hand?.
}{
Pia, hi man!. heehe. Katelynn, nossa, que feliz coincidência, há quanto tempo \o/. pow tem gente pakas neste canal. N?o acredito, encontrei voc?s ?!?!. kth, module assistant?.

what card?. ipw3945. Aqui ? bom pra testar o ingl?s. the book is on the table. that should work outta the box - you may need to grab the fw yourself. heh.
}{
there is no easy way.  there's only ...... the hard way.. why are you talking of things you know nothign about Hermina?. you built the module out of the tree?. Horacio, my processes show two ipw3945/0 processes running. but no ipw3945d. ah....
}{
just not starting the daemon. are you trying to spam someone?. email client or server?. server. the default could be improperly maintained by the distro distributor.. what distro you using?.

praises audacity and. terminatorX. two great programs... fedora 6. hi all. no i didn't.

Good morning. Hello everyone. Felicia i was reading the INSTALL file, ill check out the readme. s/hep/help. Nestor, wtf is a smurf attack?. use a smarter distro..
}{
home server?. wits are overrated thses days anyways. hello Who can Tell me How to unistall my old nvidia Driver ?. you get to co-locate your box?. ignore broadcasts?. yeah.
}{
I can't reformat the server. MEPIS is a Ubuntu (deb) distro.. Debian > *. hrm .. anomalies . is that anything like chocolate cake and canoles?. why?????????????????????????????????????????. It's an awesome audio mixing and manipulation program..
}{
is sorry.. how can i unistall Old nvidia driver ?. nvidia driver .sh. Graciela, goddamn my system wouldn't be able to handle ardour. .run i mean. Why not?.
}{
Wow, a new version! Mine is ancient, I'll have to check it out. 1-3GHZ processor atleast 256MB... I only have 800mhz and 128mb RAM. Hi all. anyone know how i can get nvidia to use its agp?. are you sure your card is AGP?  not PCI-e or pci.
}{
ok. Horacio, i found that typing ipw3945d starts the daemon. should i add that to etc/modules. yea its an agp 8x fx5200. nvidia-installer, sorry. ok.
}{
are you using a distro kernel?  distro + nvidia kernel?  or a custom kernel?. Graciela, cool, thanks. custom kernel, very little patching, just added bootsplash, and thats run by vesa and nvidia_fb stuff has not been compiled. Regenia, yup. (given they're the same type). Try Snd. It's lightweight with a nice, clean gtk frontend.
}{
I have Snd8, but I'm sure there is a new version by now. I wanted to get some ideas.... I know this is simple, but... contemplates writing vesafb code that only can load a tux that says "i hate homogenization you wintendo weenie, now get lost!". hey guys, i added ipw3945d to the /etc/modules but it didnt autostart. does that come with a pretty bar?.
}{
Most distro installers give you the option to put /home on a different partition. Graciela, anything else?. Rickey_: you're nont registered with that nick are you?. what nick?. this one?. I don't know a whole lot about it, though..
}{
th wrath of tux is a righteous mighty wicked thing to face. like that?. Ahh.. thanks. ;). confused. so isnt there some place.
}{
I can add that*. shadow, ubuntu. I suppose its 6 one way, half a dozen the other way.... .xinitrc?. ~/.xsession. or information under /usr/src/linux/Documentation.
}{
Regenia,Horacio: .xinitrc is the WM, .xsession is script-like.  I remember now.. thanks.. necesito ayuda en php pero en espa?ol. told ya i'm a putz today .. lol. some ppl here speak spanish. creo que #PHP seria mejor.
}{
Rickey_: near the end, but probably better before 'exit 0' ;). Horacio, just add ipw3945d. ?. Rickey_: the full path would be better, and any args it should have. we're all dwarves. Horacio, i dont know the ful path, how might i tell?.

no, no, Felicia is ;). oh dear .. <runs>. Horacio, nope you still are you helped me alot. so Felicia... go away!. you know solution to my question ?.

I hate LDAP schemas!. hangs on to Felicia. no good deed goes unpunished eh?. slips a banana under Felicia's feet. haha ... weeeeeeee. Horacio, ha.

you're nuts Felicia.. what did you expect it to do?. :-p. calling all spoon feeders. hehe. no, thats a bludger. :-).

oh. with roller skates ?. I've died, and gone to the sulphur-pit, it's the only possible explanation. you can't. a bludgeon is a large club.. Felicia, it's not Felicia.

Horacio, my god has died and gone to the sulphur-pit. cries. damn, useless shell. re 2 all. stupid netsplit, it missed. Salvatore, PXE boot! Yay!.

ya. like comment out eth1. hello. you no longer have your /etc/network/interfaces?. but it is not the same. here's the general overview http://www.bay-wolf.com/bootcd6.htm .. but you can use any app (wintendo or linux) to accomplish this.

#ubuntu. Horacio, smart idea. i'm only a poor songsmith, take pity on me. incredible, eh?. heh :-). you wrote it?.
}{
using skeleton. i mean you are like omniscient. Salvatore, some yes, some no.... i worship you oh great Horacio. hey ! that's my word !. wtf?.

DESC=Intel ipw3945 wireless daemon. the owner of #bash, greycat knows a trick or two. should be quoted.. Fidela, thats just the name though. Well, I'm not familiar with how to use mencoder.. hm.. oh.

oh, sorry i didnt notice him say that. no slow down ... take some valium .. sniff some paint or something .. :-p. we know you meant sanscit. Check out kino.. sanskrit ?. horrible AMC auto manus?.

sanskrit. see? :-p. heh. hi. sings along to the Rig Veda.  desk=intel ipw3945 wireless daemon      sets the variable 'desk' with the string 'intel ipw3945 wireless daemon'.
}{
Is that what you were asking? :). Gliddy glup gloopy. that page you gave me, would i just use the driver instead of a biso update?. yeah .. replace the data wwith yours. well .. you're not flashing your bios ..lol. well i fixed that desc error.
}{
but now ./ipw3945d gives no errors. and doesnt load the daemon. still nothin. hello. any ideas what i did wrong?. resatart your networking.
}{
awesomeness3, http://rafb.net/p/7R0t7k79.html. ooo sounds like it's using SSL HTML??  https://192.168.0.1/  ??. yup.. awesomeness, no , nothin. 60% of swap. well .. unload it.
}{
how?. one way is swpaoff. but why ?. better close out some hungry hungry hippo applications. like bloatware. not sure...
}{
my laptop hard drive sounds like a race car again. hey guys. minimally*. how can i force them to be unbind?. thwack that craptop homey. Anyone?.
}{
i got it working ;). awesomeness3, anyidea?. wahooo! :). (posting data part not working). k. dies.
}{
I can lose some information.... and drop_caches isn't? lol. cries. cries too. but cached memory is not "used" by the aplications. but swap is?.
}{
swap can be used by any aplication. oops...  s/lol//. lol what. ?. im so confused. Me too.
}{
Like...erhmm...   http://rafb.net/p/NuFs3821.html    notice where the "echo" statements are.. ok, so my hard drive just crashed and took down my system. what logs/etc should i check?. what S## did you give it?. Felicia s##?. ?.
}{
to a degreee. Georgia daemon should run.. are you able to download that file?. it doesnt awesomeness. Anyone hear me? ;/. it maight have been full, some stuff swapped out, and later some memory freed.
}{
I hear you :). <3. what file? lol. Horacio, whats the difference between real, user and sys?. ugh finally!. i fixed it.
}{
thx. what does "clearing a port" mean?. right?. yeah.  I'll pm you my email. i dont know. People get a lot of ambience sound when I'm on my mic...is it the mic quality or my environment?.
}{
sys + user. What Horacio said.. sys + user == total CPU time.. thank you Horacio  and Lajuana. it worked!. likely /etc/rc2.d/S99ipw3945d .. but whatever noobuntu liekly uses other files/places.
}{
you are number 6. number 9 .. number 9 ... ugh. noooooooooo. the ubuntu thing is screwed up. and wont reconnect.
}{
you are number 2 (or is it "I am ..") ..lol. using elinks i was able to get and change information on the page i needed. the url was https://192.168.0.95/pro_def.htm?vap=0. ugh screw it. :(. the entire series - http://www.tv-links.co.uk/show.do/1/2193. special attention to episode 17 - fallout. the series makers had to flee to switzerland after death threats.
}{
no wonder why .. i have my Poo blocker on :-). sent it to you.. can someone tell me where /usr/src/linux is normally linkd to?. /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build. haha .. bingo!. 64bit->128bit.
}{
open->wpa-shared. or any one of the 4. hi Denyse !. hi (again). duh.... (.)(.).
}{
\/. \ _____/. those looked like tits.. hello. I've got an rpm specfile question and #rpm seems dead.. nope, i didn't edited it and there is no "." there. they are whatever you want them to be ;-).
}{
they started out that way .. but that's too easy, and other's messed up my lil' leanardo. er leonardo. go to bed. b00!. i am tired .. again .. (ho hum). Felicia, should i remove my kernel image, the deb that i installed?.
}{
its saying its very dangerous and may cause my system not to boot. is this true?. huh?. so im trying to remove it. no :(. what?.
}{
it takes too much space. lol ... that is strange. I have no answer, but ld.so searching "." seems a security risk.. i made a deb and isntalled that. ok :], I need a new IRC client or I'm gonna blow up..I can't scroll up with Chat zilla...arrgghh!. i can remove it, but when i tried it gave me a warning saying my system wouldnt boot.
}{
case*. better rerun dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-XXXX <-- your distro version. ah okay. hello. hey I'll be back with a different IRC client..do you have any suggestions? lol. any idea on Cleopatra 's problem?.
}{
gaim/pidgin. erg !. bitchx. ?. er s/or/for. msk?.
}{
<. alright later Felicia. anyone?. or $PWD or whatever because i'm currently developping with FUSE and with the debug option I'm always seeing a lot of LOOKUP /tls /libc.so.6, etc. the boot-up wouldn't work correctly. i'm currently running DSL but it is a live USB.
}{
brb. yawns. im getting tired of being a monkey i think. "SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTA". hows it looking?. This is madness!.
}{
nope I just use it. Laurene, you just use it ... right. ? the loopaes. Someone should photoshop Bellmar.  This is not a PC! This is maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacintosh!. Laurene, no, the kernel crypto api. omg.
}{
bad. ugh. but the low latency kernel still works. any idea why the generic isnt working. Boris. anyone know how i can check whats wrong?.
}{
unable to load certificate. i'm not sure what that means and what i should tell the user re: why his cert is unreadable. holy crap. someone actually replied with the details of the apcupsd NIS protocol. did this cert ever work?. i get the same error msg when i try 'openssl verify cert.crt'.
}{
no it is a new cert. and boy is it a shitty protocol ;). how did you generate it?. Corrie, wake up. hrmmmm. it slipping my mind.
}{
does that error msg indicate his self signed cert is not 'pem encoded'?. Kacy, i dont remember what its called tho ;(. probably Boris. thinks. every */15. sounds like a stupid question but google code isnt helpign me much.
}{
just the kernel itself?. http://rafb.net/p/gdxFXg27.html. something like that. hmmm, lemme take a look.. looks good... damn.
}{
some lady was decapitated internally and survived. I've heard that Debian has a better installer. that sounds good. are you on 64- or 32-bit?. 32bit. well i have Core 2 Dou cpu.
}{
thanks. ...which is 64-bit.. or kubuntu. whats difference between k and the no k. Im on Ubuntu.com doign some research. Kubuntu uses a KDE-based desktop, Ubuntu uses a GNOME-based one..
}{
oh i hated gnome. what's XFCE?. hates them all equally, but this is largely a side effect of trying to use 64-bit ubuntu. whats regular  Ubuntu use. like I said...GNOME.. im still playing with it.
}{
sorry missed that. will the system create the folder?. Simona, no. exactly.. question marks.  Georgia `wget -O filename` gives the HTML response..
}{
oh well ... spose funny characters is busted somewhere ;). irssi. ah. but I can still say '?h?'.... I live by  [::alnum::]   :). or   [\S ].
}{
 `wget -O readthis "--post-data=$out_post" --no-check-certificate --h....`. my secondary data hds willb e fine staying NTFS right. perhaps there is a recursive copy command?.  It seems to be trying to add them recursivly, it lists all the files off but theres a ? before them. ?. ? new_dir/test_file1.php.
}{
? new_dir/test_file2.php. ? new_dir/test_file3.php. it doesnt seem to output anything. when i check out my module new_dir shows up but its empty. you got the right permissions and all that?. no output!? lol  Hmmm..  what is the output when you use a regular browser and disable JavaScript?.
}{
Im doing it straight into the shell. I can run server edition and put kde on manually . whatcha think. AHAAA IC. thanx. Thanx =). IC brilliant thanks a lot !! =).
}{
thanks again awesomess !!. add what?. 'server edition'?. hi guys. assume i don't have root access :). Sharlene, Irwin: I also highly recommend http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/06/regexp.html.
}{
thankx. after you've finish to speak i'v got an anwser. hrm. This could be a problem, then.. You could recursively hardlink~. (assuming it lets you, not sure what permissions restrict ln). laminated paper is a 70s thing.
}{
apt-get doesn't have options to use non-default directories?. and still it amazes me =D. excellent URL resource ty :). i've a exp question. Hello:). just ask.
}{
ok. i need something special. not the same distro but the fastest distro on the web. something simple and fast. they are all about the same speed. :). netconfig didnt work Justa?.
}{
gentoo i guess. i need to run a linux desktop on a 133 Mhz pc, with 64 mb of ram. stick with standard C and C++ and cross platform programming is fairly straightforward. this is the problem. not speed of install, though, :). what is netconfig?.
}{
I didn't get the PM. DSL would be pretty fast too. squirrelmail. dsl? its a distro?. ah, system calls. damn small linux?.
}{
network and system level stuff. (whereas the converse are harder to find). I tried searching google and got 2-years old results. hrm, I used to run redhat 4 on a pentium 133 many mango seasons ago. :). mmm seems nice... it has a window manager?. winsock isnt 100% compatible with bsd sockets.
}{
theres behavioral goofyness. just use functions that are available on every platform :). lol!. how many system calls are you thinking you'll need to be cross platform, and how complicated is your usage of them?. so you cant get pms?. (not that one).
}{
i know lol. maybe GTK does all those things, but i'm not sure I haven't used it. c?. hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat. and why are you using C?. Dreama, yes, each module exports the same api.
}{
cross plat?. Dreama, not atm, but theres no reason it cant be. some web sites BLOCK ping's, but have port 80 wide open.. C++ is cross plat; what are you trying to run on, embedded shit or something? :). Dreama, you cant have it ... im just telling you how i did it ;). mind dcc'n me it?.
}{
ah damn joo. hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat. ??. hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat. o:-). hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat.
}{
Dreama, and besides, libnet doesnt have a shared memory segment that emulates a socket. not everything is best programmed Object Oriented you know :]. shiiz, i got a lot of learnin ahead of me. you are not worthy of any assistance. reflect on that. my imagination is boundless :). aahh brilliant! I'm going to use that next time..
}{
YOU are number six. i thought a executable only loaded a object into memory whenever the app needed it.... ah yea, forgot about inheritance and morphism shit. oh no it overload .text. C does simple data structures just fine. dont pretend C++ is any different.
}{
i dont think so, maybe and probably tho ;). i meant data structures not like "struct" but like "vector" and "set" and "map". multimap. Christene, C gives you all those just fine. hehe. yeah.
}{
and how is that Arlie?. Christene, its the Leta of libraries. http://news.netcraft.com/. what library are you referring to that provides such structures?. Christene, supermagicklib. aahh sure :).
}{
um was that serious Arlie?. ocr scan?.  http://rafb.net/p/0cZQWp63.html. o optical character recognition... dunno why i just thot of that. you just like C++ syntactical sugar coat. don't all barcodes have theyre labels, the numbers, right under the bar?.
}{
what you're doing may require extra work.  Like some of the POST variables may be different on the browser you use when you're logged into the webui that way.. Dreama, upc does. Dreama, but thats just 1 barcode, not all of them. C++98 is far superior to the original C++, just like C99 is far superior to original C; and yes, the syntactic sugar makes code easier to understand, extend, and reuse. because like the POST variable 'passphrase' is blank...maybe it's not suppose to be blank lol. without sacrificing performance since it's still compiled to native code.
}{
"far superior" is another stretch of the truth. are the images generated programtically, or pcitures taken with a camera/scanner?. and it does sacrifice some performance ... just not much. http://sourceforge.net/projects/jocr/. Maia. c++ is like a trench coat on natalie portman.
}{
bf++. Retarded programming languages FTW!. what is a "server" these days? hahahaah. retarded programming languaes? like BASIC/QBASIC/GWBASIC? :). apache will always own 60% of the market share. hehehe.. GFA basic rulez!.
}{
how did you save the HTML files that you sent me?. Not even close Laree ;). ?. :D. barcode in, barcode out? :). yea i dont know, he asked not me.
}{
how about TRS-80 BASIC? ugh.. Laree, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck. oic. heh. yup. bf. lol. I started with basic on a trs-80 when I was a kid. :).
}{
are the images generated programtically, or pictures taken with a camera/scanner?. Laree, its called UML ;). called visual basic Laree. gfabasic was great, ok, but i prefear a bit delphi :D. They are scanned with a scanner.. oh, i'm not sure than.  only barcode stuff ive worked with was a hardware scanner that would copy the barcode number to the clipboard when you scanned it.
}{
they did, piet. I'm ussing a image scanner, not a barcode scanner.. heh. probably could using ~/.xorg edlt. why?. I need the image, that's the whole point, the barcode is just to clasify that image..
}{
I'm getting pay to scan thoses images.. tell them it is dumb to save the barcode image. I'm not scanning just the barcode image.. oh. apparently th eimage is not just of the abrcode, but the whole side of the item?. so its a full image with a barcode... ?.
}{
It's a whole document, it just contains a small barcode.. that's right. ah k. Maia, it's not free, but it's been done: http://www.softeksoftware.co.uk/linux.html. sounds like a fun project.  goo dluck. :). yeaah, already saw that, but that's pretty expensive.
}{
thanks :). are you using a program that interprets the bar code?  and actually reads the bar code?. what distro?. on login?  or when the computer first boots up?. Nicki, debian. /etc/profile?.
}{
sorry, right, I misread. /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh. http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxrecognition. the barcode encodes a number, I need that number.. hi all. encoded numbers....
}{
and by easy I mean that it works and it's possible to get it installed without 3 weeks of debugging and similar. by not closing them :).  http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&words=barcode. not really true.. hi everyone. firestarter.
}{
hello Linux friend lol. i believe the scripting fails because of the quotes. yes... thereby replacing his setup with yours - also one of the greats. Bruno, ill take a look, tnx. haha, the CueCat ... fair enough.
}{
Bruno and I have not yet come across one that qualifies. Bruno, ok. perhaps try using this command-line option with wget:   -U "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux)". and the problem with that is ?. Sharlene mosix needs specific kernel functionality, and tuning. maybe you understand that part betterthan me.
}{
well, I guess it's worth a try. Kathi not know, sorry - but every other knoppix was, so... it could be. ok, thanks anyways. such thing like        country = country name       n=Guru@DSL-202-59-71-16.nexlinx.net.pk. but others show unknown. yes, you can disallow it IIRC.
}{
but how. ??. j=-o. It sounds like you're struggling!  This is good!  Struggling => learning :). Yarg.. almost there.
}{
Oneida, http://freenode.net/faq.shtml. hehe :). what kind of weight lifting are you doing that only requires 10 lbs?. uh, a proxy?. AFAIK it's not extractable, it's just a binary image. Oh wells..
}{
Sharlene - i take it you dont lift much weights :-P. yes! lol. hehe. it can probably *use* a socks proxy. preferrably tor, i guess.. rison, :D. oohh right lol.
}{
oh, you meant "xchat comes with an automatic proxy finding thingy"... ok, that makes sense :). not really a good idea, most irc proxie or boncers are application independant. bouncers*. like say psybnc.  (the most famous of them all). omg it seems like I don't have a proxy...xchat lied :(. Maybe I have to manual configure one, I don't know.
}{
lol that is correct. that points directly to my machine. http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO#head-9fcdf56bf8a73fcebf2fdc14593e11bc96c35021. thank you, I'll give it a shot.. you're welcome. waves back to Felicia, 'thanks, how are you'.
}{
you can format it.... i'm not aware of any conversion utils, why not backup and mkreiserfs. ever hear of optical media?. :). not too bad. good, good.

I would like to compile something. Hrm. You learn something new every day.. what?. anyway, its a whole other module that im not getting into right now. no.
}{
thats a static rule. er...deal with. after X amount of time, it removes the rule. YES! I WILL!. anyway, its just a small performance enhancing method to alieviate some of the overhead involved when under attack. microsoft hasnt ever made any money.

Garrett si means Soft Interrupts. dtstat. well you could have some kind of wrapper that used ptrace or ld_preload to change the values passed to bined. dstat?. s/bined/bind/. Katie, thats hackish ;).

same. but a firewall or modifying the app code (if its availible) is almost certainly easier. yeah.... i'm talking about this program: http://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/iconvircproxy.html. http://coldfugitive.com/paste/?post=5572. people throw these things away like dead batteries anymore.

thx. Garrett whut ?. goes afk. ATI. Colene, you didnt run fast enough ?.  ATI.
}{
aye.. i was 19. i am 24 now.. thank you Colene :). motto .. you hurt Older people, or you hurt Younger people .. you die .. slowly. buy a geforece  zero :).
}{
didnt hurt anybody. or what - you'll draw a gun on me ?. hehe. head.. Colene, get a job building houses ... anything. i know nothing about construction... i got a bussines franchise going here just need customers so.
}{
well i think the  latinos are gonna  beat me to it anyways... 24? w00t .. you know about life .. LOL .. and a nyuck nyuck .. points to suse. prolly `\n`. with what command?. ?!?!?!?. ok .. *snores and whistles8.
}{
Zzzz ..Zzzzz zzzzzz. Danyel not on Linux it isn't. just wondering... Malena, google? lol :P. Malena, what happened when you tried the drivers?. windows? files, might be \r\n.
}{
Danyel pipe it through dos2unix first. sec  ill show you. direct rendering: No. THAT was the answer i needed.. thanks!. unix newline = \n  windows = \r\n  mac = \r. heh.
}{
well, internet protocol uses \r\n, :). and nothing. Nicki erm.. *which* internet protocol would that be ?. what installer?. Darlena, Nicki:  ftp, telnet, http, ssh, soap, imap4, dhcp, irc, tcp, udp, sctp, ip, icmp, ipx, arp, X.25?. heh, I was expecting someone to call me on that. :)  well, http specifies \r\n between headers, :).
}{
Nicki the one and only Internet Protocol is all binary, thankfully. Sharlene you are so missing the point. Felicia the sarge one i was having trouble with on a laptop with no internal drives except the hard drive earlier. Darlena, your welcome :). Sharlene yes, so discuss them - I'm not going to bother, we could be here all year long. that's what irc is for, isn't it? :).
}{
What's the linux equivalent to windows' "net send"?. discussion ? since *when* ? :P. Oretha it's actually *nix, not linux specific. you realize sarge is oldstable since early April right?. your you're confusion?. what codecs ?.
}{
alot .. lol and  noone lol. it is a word. it just means something completely different than the phrase "a lot". :). nope that's allot. Nicki ^^^. meaning to dole out. or distribute.
}{
like pineapples :-P. ah, right, whoops. :). I never understood the point of double letters. no native, i know. and when the list is finished, everybody WATCH OOT! muahahahah. OK, thx, I will be getting an 8800GTX 320Mb and I dont what to use Win XD.
}{
GTS*. I'm getting the same thing... whats your proc?. intel or amd?. I'm stuck between a intel quad core and an amd, prolly 6600. an Intel core 2 duo E4300. lol, mine is a little low I suspect.
}{
Felicia sure, the machine is getting upgraded to etch now. 2Gb RAM :). I hear they're gonna drop the price on quad cores, that should be awsome. SATA XD. I am running a 64-bit set-up, and currently have 2 * 1GB DDR800 RAM, would Linux have a problem with me adding 2 * 2GB sticks?. I doubt it.
}{
Natosha not linux. http://www.hispazone.com/contnoti.asp?IdNoticia=2291. doubt I will get dual channel. http://www.hispazone.com/imagenes/noticias/2291-2gr.jpg. exist any program to fix all permissions ?. is Q6600 quad core???.
}{
I dont know. I want to add /usr/local/lib to it. I am have many problems. thats awesome. Katie no, you're still crippled by the PC architecture - that is what it has to overcome. that sucks.
}{
yea. whats the deal?. I donate my PC ... lol. Katie well... "64 bit" is a bit of a... cheap shot, really. or some like that... XD. to a parent.
}{
want permissions standard. thanks a lot. what would be the use > they're screwed *now*. bytes all, g2g. are you sure windows does this and linux does not? I would bet almost the opposite. Enda, I was using XP.
}{
assuming you're still using it. predder, aahh good comment.. Yeah, most likely. Faster transfers is bad stuff.... Alisa, right now is the wrong time.. Alisa designing and producing ONE new CPU costs billions of dollars. MIPS Alpha, anyone? :).
}{
indeed, or even Sun Sparc - although they seem to have given up and now use powerpc or intel cpu's. vista is a joke. even linux programs. that I'm not sure about. All it guarantees is synchronous IO rather than buffering.. Including deferred unmounts, etc.. Okay, will do, Lajuana.
}{
there are 64-bit builds of wine that emulate 32-bit windows.. that would be stupidity. hahaha. "emulate" or "provide a compatability layer"?. yes, you laugh now. there are not, to my knowledge, any 64-bit builds that emulate 64-bit windows..
}{
that's awesome... trouble is you'd have to mess with charging it.... well, no, their not... theres speed differences amoung other things. however, wine only does one of them. fine. But apparently I was wrong!. erm, Margery.
}{
afaict PPCs main problem was IBM couldn't get it both fast and cool. :P. I don't mean to be obsitnate, I just want to know... what makes risk better than cisc?  Has it been conculsively demonstrated that cisc arcutechture just can't work?. Celsa it means that it doesn;t have to waste cycles decoding pseudo-ops, and it has very short pipelines. eh....anyone?. modern chips are somewhat of a mix of cisc and risc now.
}{
cisc only still works because intel put huge resources into making it still work ;). the solution to ever windows problem is power cycling. i mean when i add sata functionality. I did. :P. but I'm not positive..
}{
thx. Laurene, they must like star trek and futurama :) .  I wouldn't consider it wrong or bad.. oh, so thats a feature... wow, windows is pretty well designed. screem? :P. Margery, chipset?. Claretha, Laurene, well that sounds so freakin' annoying!!  It's a distraction and totally stupid!  Argh!.
}{
Actually, I'm 90% sure it's a hardware problem.  I've re-installed windows several times.  But that's another story.. spark workstation, ppc, intel, amd, etc. I know its a stupid question. Claretha, boolean(false). Oh yeah, I had a question.  I have a console app that when run, displays menus that I need to somehow traverse automatically so that the end user doesn't have access to certain options.. snort..
}{
whats the name of the app, and is it text based or GUI?. rpms can be installed by normal users, right?. not really.... because i love windows. %l Language please.  This is a family friendly channel. (supposed to be). !ohmy.
}{
and is it text based or GUI?. text based.. My linux distro doesn't seem to be giving me the power and dependability that I want... I think I might reinstall. Leonarda, bash.. heh lol!. like that.
}{
exactly why you need expect.. about 8 years ago :). Margery, what about debs?. is that what you mean?. Ah that is a great idea. Thanks!. debs can be installed by normal users, right?.
}{
*sigh*  expect isn't installed on any of the boxes I want this on....crap. wrong. kk. that's it. Thanks :-). brb guys. Adriana, hey.
}{
no clue. Leonarda, To remove a file:  `sed -i "s/^$nameOfFile .*//" text_file_db`  or something like that. Margery, cheers anyhow. ?. Rachel:. no one knows its there..
}{
lol, linux wasn't invented till 1992... whats it running?  unix?. you have heard of AT&T right?. I didn't realize they made an operating system. Margery, Bell Laboratory did a lot of OS research I believe.. its called UNIX.. Margery, forget what Ive said.
}{
brb. lol, come to think of it, I should have know that.  I always liked that chart on wikipedia about all the unix dirivatives. yes. You should have. :). although, the chart didn't show windows on it?  wtf?  I mean, everyone knows that windows is based on the fast, stable unix platform. suuuure :). Is windows the only "modern" OS that doesn't have a unix base?.
}{
it's salmon, you dolt. windows nt ... nigerian technology. salmon is just a branch off the main trout release.... isn't xp 'built on new technolgy technology'?. Salmon is version 2 of trout. Trout 2.0.
}{
:-). Margery so conceptually, they started with a POSIX-y base. nope, it's the salmon, no trouts involved. sounds fishy to me.. Margery though they managed to screw that up remarkably quickly. smackles Horacio with a trout.
}{
ok, look. There is a trout involved!. don't you mean "smackerels" ?. hurry someone!!. oh clam up. slaps Darlena with salmon. stop, the excitement is killing.
}{
Laurene no, but you could try imagemagick. Horacio, im telling you, i poo'd myself when i opened my inbox and saw that. Horacio he did that on porpoise!. This thread is floundering. Rachel heh. I've about haddock with that !.
}{
reboot, and enjoy your aids". neat. Rachel, the rest of the grouper likes me ... tough tuna. Sharlene is talking to hisself !. I have aids. aides.
}{
Sharlene, well maybe you should shut up then!. damn that is only funny when spoken. -gravity is off use ;). agrees. ..dangit!. *of use.
}{
thief!. Laurene, ??. did you know jared has aides?. they helped him to get thin?. there was a south park episode about that. it was funny.
}{
yea. NAMBLA was funny also. has to go. btw, the NAMBLA actually DO really exists O_o. Laurene, its crazy isnt it. I thought it like... illegal?.
}{
drive. drove. driven. just like that asshole with the pedophile website. sure. wtf.
}{
get hit. Darlena, this was my rules:. Laurene, that wouldnt surprise me ... catholic priests and nuns are messed up. probably a lie/joke but still wouldn't be surprise. take it to #pedophiles. no, thanks.
}{
Adriana, your awake. yeah. get hit. doesn't matter, the RCC has lost its rep.. are you on crack. get get get get get get get ged not?.
}{
quit spreading misinformation. You don't know because you're not a ranking member of the catholic church, and neither is anyone you know, or know you know.. !ops Merna is stoned and needs op attention. ok good idea hm. Darlena, sure. hmmmm. right.
}{
catcholic church is a totall failure and joke. why?. heh, all religion is a joke.  we figured it out already.  the sun isn't some god, it's a burning mass of hydrogen.. Rochel no idea what you mean by that. Darlena, on the firewall. umm, yeah ok.  Think about buddahism no god yet is a religion.  Not all religion..
}{
Rochel what firewall ?. Darlena, i need the ports opened too, right?. Rochel you're repeating yourself. Cite a single reference.. PREROUTING is enough. ahh.
}{
exactly what it says. there are many - there was a vatican document circulated saying that any such cases should be dealt with internally, and the civil authorities should not be informed. quite a scandal when that became public knowledge. the atoms must be orientated. Religion is a joke.. Priests are paedophiles..
}{
"No no that is a lie windows is NOT so bad, it is awesome!" <-- regular lamer, now s/windows/* god/g. right. crap :P. catholics are fucked up. Laurene is given to hyperbole ;). so are most religions haed.
}{
1) no possessions. and down.. and sideways. 2) no sex. someone needs to take up the God++ slack with Lai away. :). no sex*. Iraq/Iran idiots are also "no sex" / no pron.
}{
ITYM "muslims". plenty of grovelling, though.... it makes them very angry and bitter ... nuns and priests that is. i need no sex. Your credibility sinks like a cliche cruise liner when you resort to ad homonym attacks. to what?.
}{
there is not so much difference between the 'abrahamic' religions. 'ad hominem' ;(. is 'add' and 'ad homonym'? ;). er, ;). Horacio where did I even implicate that ?. flyers are cool.
}{
well, you would, with a name like that. the catholic church is a business. is Merna writting up random words?. hmmmm. I think it's a crapbot. it's a government hm.
}{
why not. shure looks like it. :D. true.. I'm not trying to cause a debate. I'm simply stating that you should believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see.. *times, even.
}{
hmm. random pointers. I know. *severe. !ops Merna is writting random nonsense (bot?). the Free Software Mob?.
}{
Honestly though, #linux. You guys are smart people, a conversation about how the catholic church is messed up is so simpleton.. don't forget about the torture before the killing.. yeah, im not dismissing religion, just dismissing the catholic church ;). Maybe the pope was the devil and he was trying to exploit the catholic religion!  It's all coming together now.. Adriana why not ? religion *is* an "act of humans". Flying Spaghetti Monster of course!.
}{
may not believe the RCC is gods representative religion on earth, but that doesn't mean its not rel. you must be new here. :). you cant read?. oh, that upstart heresy. religion is a prescribed philosophy. hmmmm.
}{
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!. Yesenia and how is that not acted out by humans ?. how old are you. 1,0 dioptrine. Well, you want to get technical about it. Everything humans have ever experienced has been through the senses of a human, and therefor everything ever is an act of a human.. right.
}{
the act of experiencing, the act of observing. tnx. Darlena, it is supposed to be alright, right? http://pastebin.ca/508441. .... Darlena, it is supposed to be alright, right? http://pastebin.ca/508441. shhhh, a linux question.
}{
where? where?. biblical archeaology...  that's where someone strongly biased twists ambigious evidence to conform to his obesessive world-view, right?. well, iptables, :). http://pastebin.linuxfromscratch.org/?show=3552. hmmmmmm. Good stance. You should check out the american skeptic's society.
}{
the world is round, peoples brains are flat. "fat".... Darlena, tnx man, it all worked. hmmmmm. ah, well, screen + irssi... so.... So much misinformation, so many assumptions, so little rationality..
}{
indeed, starting with you. talking of flat brains ;). grow a spine, it's all will power. dam dam dam dum. Horacio, whats FSTDT ?. Adriana my spine is one of my weaker points.
}{
I can tell. Yesenia well, religious nut or not, you're preaching. Right. Whatever, noob.. <Yesenia> .... so little rationality.  << indeed. irrationality is the foundation of all revalatory religions. hmmmmm. heh, I never get tired of that.
}{
it's obvious. get a real distro?. hahaha. well, i really dont know, so, tnx all. :D. gone.
}{
prefers to tan. sure ... i knew einstein was a satan worshipper ... noone would listen tho. this is a real distro, you build your own. is it really that bad to worship satan, I mean historically (before the RCC destroyed it) he isn't evil, he just wanted humans to be human.. sailing. stars.
}{
Are you describing religous fundamentalists?. bar Jonah, Theology Web [Comments (71)] [2006-Jan-20], apparently. Arlie that is priceless :). .... Anybody?. mind-blowing, eh?.
}{
I'm trying to compile Xorg 7.1. Horacio, truly ;). "I want a satanic funeral." "BOOOO!". bah. He could be using lfs to learn system development cycle. I just want help, not a arguing contest.
}{
is he crawling because he's sinning, or crawling because he's penitent?. that's a sad quote.. scarey, huh?. Is that real?. I can't believe someone would say that. Bryon, ah ... but they did ;).
}{
it appears to be. so yes. Thats preaching. the biible mistakes its own. ". Becki, its not a random work of fiction. english? haha.
}{
that shitty language, hope not. much of it is highly self-serving mythology. er..ancient. Nicki  what is difficult is that religious nuts cannot and will not understand that not everything is connected to religion. not to my knowledge. Don't you feel silly disagreeing with such a logical argument?.
}{
Love and blessings Don". What the Hell is going on?. Oh yeah, oh yeah, I just got myself a new lappie. "Buggrit!".  of course not.. you're missing some library that libxfont expects to be there..
}{
Huh?. Which one?. ""Make sure your answer uses Scripture, not logic."". I deleted some tarballs intentionally. gods wife left him. no, we're just enjoying http://fstdt.com/top100.asp.
}{
S/out/our. Just saying your complaining will accomplish absolutely nothing.. Wonderful.. teehee. I dunno.. "who? me?".
}{
damn !. Religion just makes me think we should all be upgraded by the CyberMen.. I'm outs, guys. Take care.. cya. What's FSTDT?. "I didn't come to Jesus by my intelligence and neither will you my friend.".
}{
Horacio, amen brother. scratch "his". Nicki, Yesenia aahh such friendship lol. probably himself.. :P. First it's evolution. Then comes plate tectonics and the Big-Bang. Then comes Athiesm..
}{
we should have Religious Death Match on TV - Amazons vs Christians, Buddhists vs Muslims, all sorts of fun would ensue. Lianne, me ?. Nicki, Yesenia Whatever happened to "Love thy neighbor?". Lianne, some page with wacked out quotes o it. we have that.. oh cool.
}{
Lianne, http://fstdt.com/top100.asp. its on the news every night. err "the flying spaghetti monster gospel". Rachel oh yeah, I forgot - it's CNN, isn't it ?. what's wrong with the good old 'christians v. lions' ?. Yup :-).
}{
xtrans-1.0.3.tar.bz2 , libfontenc-1.0.4.tar.bz2 -- already installed them. we ckilled most of the lions.... hey... that could work.... Horacio I think it's mental torture to the lions, they should quit that shit. Nicki We always give the linux questions priority.. "Is Linux really Free, or is it enslaved by the Philistines?".
}{
most of the talk of the channel is offensive to you?. Tonita, random insane people. Any one  with a question?. what's the best linux distro?. Thats a religous question. :-). and should I use gnome or kde?.
}{
Rachel, Don't answer! lol. sure... how to fix acpi support on my asus laptop?. so that. haha!. prayer my son!. what's wrong with it?.
}{
me also distro wars caused me to use alot of good linux distros. cluebat not recognised ? that's bad. google knows nothing?. sounds liek a it needs some specific MB driver code fro mASUS?. *like. freethinking is a very popular self-deception.

MB?. heh IRCnick fiction.... mainboard. WTF?. Lianne, your gonna stab me spirit ? you bastard !. IRCnick fiction....
}{
ah. yea, well... probably. but thatshit scares me :P. me tto.. too. tried that the other day, there are several warnings (like "unreachable statement"). ok, I take your point ;). Wait...maybe I had "../lib-7.1.wget" screwed up.
}{
sorry I mean right wing conservative christian. heh, I was wondering about that, :). but i have no clue how to fix them.. "right wing liberal " just doesn;t parse, so no worries. a standpoint I holdheartedly agree with. hehe, religion.  funny stuff.  you guys would probably enjoy this: http://www.cracked.com/index.php?name=News&sid=1649&pageid=5.

oh great, now I'm stuck on trying to figure out how to create a right wing liberal...... Tonita and that's the jism ? or did you really mean "gist" ?. caution bad words. so I can't spell.  relax chief. is a kgosi. satanist!.

is it possible to serve up regular web pages on the same machine that is running mongrel_rails?. Arlie, I was not claiming that. the reason is i wanna serve up templates. That's just lovely. hehe Europe without public education would be like the US is right now :0p. wasent bashing, was just being realistic.

yes, europeans are so smart. Sharlene possumness3. are you sure, Jana they could easly fool me :). Georgia average American probably has an IQ below 70. howdy linux folk,. No.

No. hm.. looks like I've stepped into a godwin situation.. we haven't had Ashcroft's Corollary yet ;). :). Leonarda, you have no idea how quick 2gb of memory gets used up. Leonarda,  wasn't that limitation lifted with 2.6?.

fine, shiny. happy?. Tonita, very true, i blame the Educational System and the lack of proper parental guidance. one app can easilly eat several gigs of ram. i'm an American. haha.

DARKGirl,  49% will tell you vi, 49% will tell you emacs.. why are you compiling it?. ESEX. and I know 0% of those, neither they're GUI-like. yep wireshark has a ton of plugins and each needs compiled. using emerge on gentoo...

why did they rename ethereal to wireshank?. vim-gtk and emacs-x11 :). fork / dev disagreements. sigh. anyway it took 16 minutes on my 1.9GHz pentium M. I'm not a fan of 'broadcast' media.

try Eclipser. nope. week. ok ;) so next timethen. or tar.bz2 even. and other factors, but that's the main one.

Hmm. I'm tar.gz a full web-hosting home directory. tar.bz2 it. what would the general range of that be?. 80%. depends ;).

ll. 80% of the original size?. ugh. yeah. Thanks. Yeah.
}{
the only types of graphics that will compress are .bmp and uncompressed .tif and maybe a small numbers of others. whats the app that routes a serial console to tcp/ip ?. Velva, a combo of minicom and ssh?. whatever happened to jpeg2000. move it. when i move it to the right, its not moving. when i lean it to the left, its going left.
}{
Capt. Obvious helps again. ?. Your mouse is not working correctly.. Capt. Obvious helps yet again. Laurene : thanks! that helps. Obviously.
}{
Velva, how would you connect to serial otherwise?. Laurene, it was redesigned to use wavelets (jpeg2000 used fourier series). (which caused, bleeding between contrasting colours). any reaon to use apache over lighttpd ?. stil compiling. older system?.
}{
I noticed that /var/log/boot is not getting logged to when one of my machines boots up, any idea's why it isn't being logged to ?. lighthttpd is single threaded ne pas?. i'm not sure. naaahhhaaaaa. wow, jpeg2000 is OUTSTANDING. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JPEG_2000_Artifacts_Demonstration.png.
}{
100x compression (1% of oryginal) and still is ok !!!!. so i kinda got to use apache. so does the app i use, gallery, but I was able to get it to work with it. its a 2 ghz. i dont knwo the equivalent. Gia, but i agree about the "out of the box" easyness.

emailed it , haha. oh so console>screen uses pts. ayuda en espa?ol. hello. try asking ##windows. what..?.

}{
yeah try something like tinyurl.com. sorry, didn't think it was that long. con php. yay! imagemagick. Can't even figure out how to issue it. it probably can't deal with those either. the problem is the format you're trying to use is closed and proprietary. good luck..

oh, CS2... what makes those?. I meant pdf files created using photoshop CS2. *psd. Good evening. Horacio, what's wrong with psd?. closed, proprietary, secret, evil, ... need I go on? ;).

We have a high budget graphic studio around here. I dunno, a lot of formats aren't. what the hell. no, jpeg is lossy compression. you could use uncompressed tiff and be fine. I would people could un-do flash format and player..

so it wouldn't have its own soundcard built into the usb device? because I have seen usb speakers that claim to be a sound card. Laurene, they exist. just like a software modem. ah, ok. Katie, Raquel: thx. crashes on his keyboard "fdjskafhsdjkafdaskl".

nah. you cant have that whithout eating nothing. did someone say crazy ass weather?. just out of curiosity, can you recommend a linux compatible brand of sound card?. hmmmmmmmmmm. Kemberly not off hand, tbh i don't use linux on the desktop enough to care about sound.

ah, ok. stripes. stand up, stand up jonny.... *zink. how about that indeed Oretha. about what?.

Anybody familiar with using a crossover cable?". ...there's not really much to be familiar with.. Apparently enough to mystify me :-(.. I have a crossover cable connecting my laptop (ubuntu) with an appliance running cclinux.. I have a console on the appliance, too.. well, the difference is basically...a normal cable connects a computer to a hub. A crossover cable connects a computer to a computer or a hub to a hub..
}{
There, there's all there is to know about crossover cables~. i installed ndiswrapper, but i still have no wireless... what am i missing?. i also installed the driver. That is, the appliance is configured to have a static IP of 192.168.1.50, but pinging that IP gets me "destination unreachable".. Lajuana - just fyi hub to hub you normally use a straight through. but otherwise you need a crossover cable.
}{
rsa >. so am I. And some of them don't have uplink ports.. thought that most 100 mbit switches had auto mdi-x on every port. Katie - everyone i've seen does. only non auto mdix devices i've seen are 10 or 10/100 hubs. it should be wherever you configured your torrent client to save it..
}{
it's not. .... will be right back.. rsa is better?. bittornado. Julius - I've never had any problems with it before, but this is weird - where did my data go!.
}{
lol. I get some random error. beware of /usr/local. ta ta. default it installs to a wx directory. preposterosity !.
}{
/usr/lib. no, "python". it's some other places too.... dooood ... your gettin a dell. la la la la la .. la la la la. didn't the dell dude smoke pot and go to jail or something?.
}{
i think he killed his parents. thus one can derive, use dell -> go to jail. hans reiser is a big dell fan. bah, im starting to regret using slack just a little bit. owned!. how can you regret slack?.
}{
i thouht he was just fined, but yes, he did get 'caught'. you should probably just get azureus - it's java, so it usually works, wherever. "Senator Warns of Email Tax This Fall"  <- LOL! is this the same senator that thinks the internet is made of tubes?. email tax funny. coming to you this fall to screens near you, EMAIL TAX!!. i tried azureus too.
}{
oh. anyone here knows the relationship between sendmail and dns trying to resolve a issue. maybe it will finally force email to die and everyone will use IM instead. Julius, and I suppose it wouldn't compile right?. a domain?. what is azureus?.
}{
why are you using torrents? warez kiddy?. 1: yes, i am a warez kiddy i guess  2: i love the protocol. Laree, thats the attention grabbing headline that slashdot poster made up. how did you know i was reading slashdot. ;). internet sales tax is the stupidest thing ever. Laree, phone and cable are already taxed.
}{
the regular tariff. shrugs and says "americans". american tax. :). aka "fat freedom bringers". huh?. I wonder whey there will GTFO of 'nam II.
}{
how would we run fiber lines than though Arlie?. dark fiber is yummy. it tastes like internet potential. taxes, and the us dollars they must be paid with, is what creates work. im sure they have some involvment with the laying of our fiber networks. they have to, its too important to leave to some company.
}{
demand and people willing to supply makes work ?. s/spend/spent/. the fiber thing?. Julius, no, no police. oh. is there a ##linux-offtopic, or is random stuff just ok here.
}{
pixies. Julius, it grows on trees ;). the fed makes money. :). right ... its just dirty paper. because you need it to pay taxes. you can pay taxes with chickens or eggs.
}{
er..cant. sure you can. you dont borrow money. you exchange it. oh wait, this isn't the 19th century. :). Laree, shut up, you can not.
}{
Julius, huh ?. how would you borrow money? a loan i guess. a loan that is never paid back. lol. that is why we have this huge huge HUGE national debt. ;). i thought this was a support channel!. have huge national debt because we over spend and lose our damn money. Julius, no its not.
}{
40 years ago it was, but not today. huh, thot it did to an extent. guess not... you would think it partially does though. yea. money grows on trees. heh.
}{
it has no value by itself. quite literally, yes. :). cotton grows on trees, right? :). I've got a money tree on my desk ;). well, plants. :). you cant own anything, without paying some tax on it.
}{
either sales tax, or gas tax, or property tax, or whatever, everything is taxed. it's like paying a huge maphia some "protection money" heh. Laree, thats exactly what it is. and taxes must be paid with currency. of course the govt doesn't actually fight wars. they outsource that to the people themselves by putting out carrots on a stick. ;). everything creates demand.
}{
and its the system of taxes and money, that regulates the consumption of the population. does sex create demand? </sarcasm>. ah yes... modern day slavery. ;). "everything" doesnt create demand. supply doesnt create demand.
}{
sure it does. nevermind ... im tired of trying to educate people. thats the stock market, work with supply to choose your demand. why not? :). the stock market is nothing but a big popularity game. :). lol i guess yea.
}{
Julius, despite what the publicly disclosed accounting says. what's the trick? hide the huge debt and have people to borrow from? :). what.... Laree, the trick is paying employees with stock and stock options. Laree, aka the enron scandal. BINGO..
}{
your paying people with hyperinflated non-real assets. "krustyland money! it's just like real money, but 'fun'!" :). lol. lmao.. so .. microsoft made no money, and paid no federal taxes. "your_corp_here stock certificates. it's just like real wages but 'fun'!"   :).
}{
by selling hope and a dream to investors. Julius, modern economies have something better. super slaves?. because assets stay within a company. you're buying them up cheap and eventually it will skyrocket. :). super slaves? lol. programmers?.
}{
russian serfdom woot! - SUrely there is another channel you can use to talk about stuff like this. slave^2. outsource to india!. i just now realized why there was a war over slavery. Julius, you want workers to be happy. theyll like it....
}{
sure it does. so it boosts overall output. lol. Julius, im one of them. me either. can anyone help?.
}{
hey are there any roll-up dvorak usb keyboards out there?. plug the cable in.. Whats an english name starting with C ?. Laree, pizza places ... its close but not exactly the same thing. nice/short/common one. its not dog food.
}{
its one grade above. Laurene, Charles. lol. oh i mean "ground beef" :). its it spelled Charls ?. :). yea, thats a grade above pet food.
}{
you get what i mean with "eat the dogfood". :P it's an expression. Laurene, no ;). Arlie, hi. hey, it sells dont it. is me wwallace. Kathleen, your not wwallace.
}{
pet food, now with fake protein!. i am. fool. your avecado. that kills your pet bonus. well my wifes puter.
}{
exactly. wheres anferva_lap. is disconnected. atm. maybe you should have had a pet life insurance policy on it. :). good .. you beat the disease ... good deal.
}{
and my server wich is wwallace. needs a power supply. million dollar pet life insurance policy. you can burry your pet with rhine stones. :). anyone?. Kathleen, you know you can use the same irc nick, no matter what computer your on. i know.
}{
im just lazy to /nick wwallace. '/nick wwallace. admitting you have a problem is the first step. my password is 15 characters long. i'm having a problem. Resource temporarily unavailable.
}{
the next step is changing it. the third step is paying the Eartha on the way out of my office.. It's a shared host,too. run the dish washer. Laree, an answering machine to screen calls is cheaper. Laree, ?. asterisk box works better.
}{
gues no has seen my problem?. i'm confused Laree. is coolmax a good ps?. is 90 dollars. no. define good.
}{
so i think it must be good. all PSUs die. even very expensive ones. no. $90?!. $150-200 is normal.. hrm... my 500watter's with a 5.25" fan and a 80mm fan normally run maybe $35-50.
}{
because theres a reason no?. i presume mine are good because i've yet to have one die... since say '97 or so. I compared it to others on the site. Laree, hah.. compared using what criteria? :). has anyone ever run into this problem before..?.
}{
well is fancy. i have to connect all the cables separatly. and is quiet. like the cables rare separate. thanks. i take it this is a system you're not rooted on? - also a common thing on a VE pending how the admin has it setup.
}{
I'm not too sure what makes a good ps, maybe I got a badone. ... no. PSUs *do* die.. fan can die.... coils can short or change capacitance..... Routing tables on my laptop or on the cclinux box?. can a x86_64 run on ix86 machine. overvoltage can happen. overcurrent can happen....
}{
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817159040">COOLMAX CP-500T EPS12V 500W Power Supply - Retail</a>. I should have got one with SLI.... can a x86_64 apps run on iax86 (mmx compatible, i586) machine. you could get dual PSUs. sure, but it can still wear down, or be drawing too much current, etc. etc.. hence "protect" not "eliminate" ;).
}{
depends how critical the system is. :). is it worth the extra money to buy a $500 PSU, or is it just a cheapo system. is this a cheapo server or what?. can a x86_64 apps run on iax86 (mmx compatible, i586) machine!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Laree - no, a desktop. ?.
}{
why the ?. what's so cheapo. (I just want to know so I can get a better one next time). oh. i gotcha. just get a coolermaster green series one or an antec or something.
}{
exactly. a "not expensive one" is a cheapo one. :). sure, why not. :). ok : ) "cheapo" threw me off a little. i wasn't sure. how so? it is literally what you are thinking. :). i've been watching Scrubs all day.
}{
I say cheapo to mean crap, and inexpensive to mean ok, but not expensive... that's me though. shame on you. Laree, why?. imagine how turk would feel. Demetra, satisfied?. STOP TALKING TO YOURSELF! :->.
}{
Demetra > /dev/Demetra. :(. I prefer hand made. but i dont wanna go to daddy. would it. ?.
}{
why not?. ok. n/m then. :). Laree - I can - it didn't have a rebate when I bought it. is what's his name (the mentor) still treating what's his name like an intern? :). "well newbie" hehehe. :->. i'll give you a spoiler.
}{
your dad is ypur master, your dad is /dev/Demetra, He already annihilated you. the rebate on newegg brings it down to $40. so it must only cost them $20 to produce it then. hehehe. Dr. Cox, IRRC.. yes. Dr. Cox is like, "well newbie". lol.
}{
i'd probably think either the metal enclosure, or the coils. no. they have a soldier bath. I'm just messing with you, you may speak now. china. i always thought i was nuts to build my own.
}{
a PSU can be a computer too. it's got a few bytes of RAM, a tiny dedicated microprocessor.... (maybe). (if you're lucky. heh). 5V 12V negavive and positive. have an antec.
}{
i mean literally a $500 power supply. not an antec. heh. ??? vnc. Arlie, < 1024. is that like, a tcp port ?. root access would allow them. :). you can have it load during bootup.
}{
what is a "service port"?. it sounds like something sexual. "service port". just about all of them. Toya, i dont know what people want when they dont tell me. hi. Rhett, sure they can.
}{
Arlie, no they can't. Rhett, why not ?. and somehow the "service ports" aren't?. that's what she said. :). by default. instead, the kernel will typically give you the lowest unused port > 1023.
}{
what is that?. yes.. you mean phpmyadmin?. I have a server running fedora core 5. and xampp. did you try google yet?.
}{
or a good book maybe. try specifics. what database. what linking language. Rhett, no, i just found out that linux does prevent binding below port 1024. unless the process is root. Arlie, yeah i know.
}{
and the database?. Rhett, tell me how it affects security when you have a firewall that can block any port you want ?. try this. mysql / PHP. there are many MANY books on just that.. Arlie, i want to listen on a < 1024 port so i can fool my isp bit torrent shaping.
}{
well you needed to give specifics first. there are many databases out there, many web/linking languages. you could, alternately, rewrite the packets. I want to learn how to use the mysql and phpmyadmin I have loaded so I can create a forum. but im suspecting Rhett doesnt have a root account. *heard, never took the Linux+ exam personally. so many what?.
}{
hi. I want to add a forum to one of my websites. Makeda, phpbb3. Laree, pretty much. China, hi. that's dumb.
}{
switch?. the commands used to signal a modem - attention dialtone ( atdt ). one of the questions on the Linux+ exam should be, "Do you know what a Eunic is?" heheheh. try it an see. :P). # clamdscan virus-20070423-3662. ----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------.
}{
Infected files: 1. 0.842 sec (0 m 0 s). Rhett, listen carefully. why is it a security risk?. heh. # clamdscan virus-20070423-3662.
}{
/var/virusmails/root/virus-20070423-3662: Worm.Stration.pac-1 FOUND. ----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------. Infected files: 1. 0.842 sec (0 m 0 s). thats on a P3 500MHz machine. Arlie, thank you, i think that will work.
}{
lol. exactly.. Rhett, so ... socket() bind() setuid() listen(). Rhett, or socket() bind() listen() setuid() ... whichever one works. "whatever floats yer eunic boat". eunics boat. or basically, you have to know a programming language well.
}{
very well. a forum is very complex. exactly what Demetra said. go get a PHP/Mysql book. No I don't yet so any books you would recommend. Makeda, i would recommend you learn Ruby on Rails. it's state of the art, 2.0, and very powerful.
}{
NO!!!!!. and much easier than php/mysql. What are some good lightweight distros?. Jenae, DamnSmallLinux, Slackware. Laree, why?. guys over here?.
}{
so i don't have to learn a new language. :). Laree, what's a meme?. Laree, RoR is absurdly easy o.o. PHP is absurdly easy. Laree, PHP is easy but overly complex when scaled. there are so many examples on php.net and libraries out there, it's silly.
}{
that's true, but it's the general accepted convention that <1024 ports are usually servers/daemons with sometimes rather high privs. Laree, it's because it's been out much longer. Ninfa, one second. cplay. Gale, but it's not a security risk, unless i run #hackmenow --port 5. it's an inter-process communication framework, so you can have a dbus-compliant client send messages to dbus programs.
}{
CORBA, RPC, COM+.... whats like c++ but better ?. heck, you could even call SOAP one. cool can you email it to me. pleasr. http://tryruby.hobix.com/.
}{
there it is. hope you appreciate it, ran across teh apartment. :). ty Demetra I will try it. Makeda, enjoy :). no problem, come back anytime..
}{
has briareus been here latley. !seen briareus. i got private messaged by a bot, January. cool. I am fairly new to linux. !help.
}{
just being honest. !1337. !1337. Ninfa, :). keep the praise, just send money. Makeda, werd.
}{
Makeda, i've been into computers since 6 :). I have you beat, but I was learning the alphabet, not coding then.. http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fccrma.stanford.edu%2Fplanetccrma%2Fman%2Fman1%2Fvkeybd.1.html&ei=wW5WRryWKpL-gwPKwcDLBQ&usg=AFrqEzc_yDxdhrA5HFYU33lrRPVOSbHcrQ&sig2=BEC_C19jqAGrtae5xitvCw. Learned on a Sincla Spectrum ZX. i need to figure out how to use vkeybd --addr desetination or something to use 128:1 port instead of 129:0. Heh.
}{
*Sinclair. wow thats old. so not to be too much of a bother, but again, does anyone have a favorite CLI music player?. Glynda, your joking, right ?. you took the word out of my mouth :P. I bet that created a bit of dilemma -- chicken before the egg problem.
}{
he screwed you, that probably borked your system good, huh.... not this one. guess you'll now be having a bit of trouble changing mode on files lol. reconfigure chmod, that should fix it. Talia, you think thats cool, my windows box automatically reboots itself every day ;). hopefully....
}{
lol. Mpd was the other one I heard about but forgot the name of recently. Thanks, googling it again.... Sure thing.. !seen Madeleine. turn the monitor off.. playing halo 2.
}{
thanks! So many commands that are so useful alone, but rarely used, that I can never remember them :P. http://cdn5.tribalfusion.com/media/799286/300x250_Big_Enlarge.jpg. thanks. check /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt. Chandra, I tried console=tty00,9600 but I think it is too new.... Xorg is compiling....
}{
It'll take about 20 min.. why turn off X to use bittorrent?. greeting friends. you save a whole penny every ten gallons. buy a honda. .001 cents buys an odd gallon?  I want 30 odd gallons now.
}{
and so on, and it'll grow exponentially! I only need to worry about losing my entire savings before it hits one penny due to roundoff error.. er...1 cent. gnight Makeda. sweet, xorg is installing now!. lol Ninfa. I don't think P3 supports frequency scaling.
}{
Fannie, probably not. Fannie, i have an athlon64 3400+ that doesnt support it either. aww. Seriously?  My 3200+ does.... Tova, i think its a mobo bios issue, not the cpu itself. Oh, I see..
}{
P3 does not support CPUFreq scaling. Fannie, not exactly, but yeah mostly. I think it's a requirement of chipsets, cpu, and bios. lol. or use an 80s computer. http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/x7driver.html.
}{
1980's?. yeah. Wait.... ok. gotcha. Fannie, turn off a lightbulb and forget about it.
}{
that makes sense. lol. linux asm is my main concerN. And hack their wireless router and change the channel to a frequency that doesn't conflict with ours. consumption depends on your PSU right?. Ninfa, sure.
}{
can someone kick me ?. kicks Velva. Ninfa, ncurses ;). ugh. its a conspiracy !. it seems like it should be easy but i dunno how.
}{
tried that first, no reply :-(. oh.. im not finding any decent ascii art. http://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/index2.shtml. Hello again. Trying to compile 2.0.0. Fixed the 'easy' errors, but now have this. any ideas ?.

dam. me either. c++ is my mainstay.. maybe some prolog and lisp but that's about it. use VNC server without prompt.  Btw, shich server DOES such prompt?. server w/o prompt?. on the client or server end?.

prompt o/w server ?. most server dont have such prompt on server end. RealVNC does.. it has an option.. yeknomdaeh ?. Georgia Windows version anyway.

i fixed it. Laurene_: hot chicks w/dicks don't like all that BEEPing .. so tone it down :-p. Felicia, thats an oxymoron. bleached, or blanched? ..lol. http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archive/slashdotted =). Felicia, whats that supposed to mean ... theres no thought behind that.
}{
how are you honey .. lonely tonight?. hey Arlie .. here comes the stooges .. :-). GPLv2?. it's not against the gpl to charge money. No.. erm... no, why.
}{
GPL are not communists. Dubbya  is though. that makes a whole lotta sense dude. potato!. boise even. Laurene_: it's called 'plunger distro'.
}{
I suppose beeping also trigger the plunger, now THAT would be userfriendly, debian-style. oh, pressed the tab.. *smack*. they put the beep there to filter out the noobs. http://bash.org/?765967 I feel ripped off :(. flips*. just replace the beep with a bsod so they'll feel comfortable.
}{
http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archive/gpl-sucker-punch. i like the action oriented, interactive nature of this dostro though ;-). er distro*. it's like wii-be-a-toilet distro ;-). lol. sounds like a suse clone.
}{
just trying to give them (what they really want) and what they're trying to push on us ;-). http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archive/referential-integrity. sick sick sick. lllllllllllllllllllllll. boo yah bitches. actually he is correct.
}{
ah .. my little geek peeps. all tuckered out. driving with your eyes closed. ?. im just saying random strange stuff ;). im bored.
}{
tired of writing and debugging code. no you dont ;). LOL, unics, that you?. whats the best technique to generate entropy on a remote server that has no keyboard or mouse?. yeah. Glennis, sound card.
}{
can you explain?  i've been trying everything and the entropy is always so low. ?. ooh niice. hmm, not even sure the server has a sound card, it's terminal only. does it have a pci slot ?. constantly generate a random seed file?.
}{
yah. get a sound card, or even better, an fm tuner card. yes, you can access zee audio buffers. how can you check your entropy level?. would d/ling files also help?. well right now i'm trying d/ling software.
}{
it's writing to disk so it must create some. Glennis, disk activity generates entropy. :(. well, the disk activity might. theres a paper on the internet about linux secure random number generator not being all that secure. "Linux kernel violates 42 M$ patents," -> http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39287061,00.htm, tell me its wrong.
}{
maybe i should get someone by the server to mash on a keyboard :(. Glennis, i told you ... sound card or fm tuner card. its a $30 solution ... and its secure. yeah, i'll try that tomor. later. today.
}{
http://www.theregister.com/2007/05/24/microsoft_novell_patents/. Glennis, thats secure, and remote ? not likely. Glennis, fan speed ?. http://www.rebelforums.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3385&st=0&#entry36800. Glennis, this all boils down to how good of a random number you want. s/utility/use/.
}{
i would rather random than urandom. this*. Glennis, network activity would normally be good, except an attacker could monitor it. Kiesha, M$ said there their are violated patents, they won't say what (because its "too much work"), and they said they won't sue. I don't understand what the problem is. Glennis, so the real secure choices are sound card, fm tuner card ... etc..
}{
they are a) analog b) not transmitted or related to network activity and c) unpredictable. so just using the sound card will generate entropy?. Glennis, sure, just record nothing. Glennis, it not, hook up a microphone. er..if not. stick the microphone inside the card ... and blow a fan on it.
}{
er..case. Mark, the sound card wont record silence. any commandline utility you can recommend to utilize a sound card, seems foreign to me to be playing music through terminal. What's a statement called that has illogical support?. Glennis, sure. i could prob try using it right now, obviosuly i wont hear anything, heh.
}{
Glennis, but the compression needs to be percentage and not absolute ... dont just turn 100 0's into 1 0. Glennis, perhaps multiple each 16 bit recorded value by a number that gives you a full 0-65535 range. er..multiple. damn. multiply. Glennis, your gonna be recording somehow, right ?.
}{
the data Alesia, whatever it is. those are your bits. i c. yup ;). anyone use imagemagick?  im going out of my mind, trying to figure out why it's rendering every 2nd image @ 25% size, when converting jpgs to pdfs. I used imagemagick.
}{
how're you converting?. hmm. tried convert/mogrify?. tourrettes / tourettes ;-). yeah that. Felicia, ty ill try that.

just a guess/ thought. is it a new PCI device?. Glennis, you still here ?. I think i accidentally found the p0rn keyword capital of the world ..lol. Arlie, yep. craptop?.

hi Felicia. yo Brain. Jacqueline you want to add an existing NTFS partition to an existing ext2 partition *and* leave the NTFS one intact ? that's...silly. Is there any libre equivalent to tools like SpinRite?. nope. 'add them together' ?.
}{
Kathi it indicates a severe Quinton incompatibility with your hardware - possibly a memory issue. hmm. i succesfully compiled both openmosix and openssi on a i686 machine running debian. http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/25/sony-really-knows-how-to-screw-its-customers/. what architecture are you trying to compile for?. i686.
}{
hi. just remembered these are celerons and not p3. well afaik, coppermine is p3. i'd say it's i586. atleast it looks like some safe CFLAGS listing says it's i686. actually i don't think it could cause a compiling error.
}{
CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu" CLFAGS="-march=pentium3". Hey, anyone here know much about apache virtual hosts?. #apache ?. i had no problems compiling openmosix. however, the hang up is weird, is that an embedded computer? where is your machine trying to load the image from? hd?. the apache docs are a good staring point i think. agreed, it is weird, just a normal small fujitsu-siemens computer, and it's loading the image over PXE like it's supposed to with OpenSSI.
}{
well, atleast when I tried to compile openmosix, I did triple check those things. harreo. :). I'm about to try OpenMosix. is it any good?. i liked my previous nick phucktheWorld.
}{
alpha doesnt always = not stable. alpha can be damn stable with missing features. liek configurability. and maturity,. because I'm too lazy is why.. i'm horney.

<Glady> Felicia: I'm about to try OpenMosix. i get hardon all day. so go try it .. and shutup ;-). huh?. change about to to thinking about to. lol.
}{
grab the debian sources and try using make-kpkg. 2.2.x. this channel is dead or what. that's an old Quinton. so is i486.. yep, but older hardware still exists, and older kernels (unpatched) are exploitable ;-).
}{
exploitable hmm? PM me :P. ?. hey dude can u tell me what chkconfig is all about. it's damn irritating when OSes refuse to boot 'coz of bios options, and that aint even that uncommon.... Kathi congrats :). mainly 'coz every goddamn bios has used a random generator on their menu items.

*item names. atleast. so i add the httdp2 to rc5.d. doom 3. doom 3 can i pm you. sure.

oh. why you copy my nick. ???. are you ok?. mindless just a fyi, the p-pro and better are 686, it's the amd k6s that are -586 only (and perhaps the k62/3 sare 686 capable, i forget). why.

it was your fault i guess. hasnt been following the convo, but he is a c'er. Bo, how so?. (ethernet). how is this connected to your pc?. it's not a PC, blackfin architecture.
}{
we have a custom bfin board, and we controll bl with the dac of the touchscreen driver. ;). That's the way terminal work. :). HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN !!. grins.
}{
stops.. Hoa, we're quite good. anyway thanks Everette. :). That statement is a confusing question.. you mean me?.
}{
looks around .. and points. aww shittards. ncurses ?. something like that. sorry.. my RAM went crazy. that 3/8 ain't cutting it.
}{
puts Felicia into a padded cell.  enabling it where ?. why don't you try #ubuntu?. wherever you installed it according to the instructions, Shelley. :-$.  my self ...
}{
?. does your httpd.conf have something related to php?. what ditro?. ue your package manager to ensure php is installed. Azzie you don't always need one. Fixed it!  Change the ReadMode(0) to ReadMode(1).
}{
 ubuntu .... this doesn't sound like a very good idea to me. that is, indeed, a bad idea. Marline, u shouldnt 777 /var/www*. ;). thank you. it works perfect.
}{
Marline you've been a web developer, but obviously never a system administrator. webdeveloper != sysadmin. lol. tell me. just because 777 "makes stuff work", doesn't mean it's the correct method. lol. my ip-address is 192.168.0.135. Now try to hack me..
}{
..... and yea. 'that will work'. but its a shit ass way of doing things. his external IP is 213.67.173.34 btw lol. i know how :).
}{
;]. files*. like everyones been saying, just cause it works doesnt mean its a proper way of doing sheit. haha, doesnt mean thats where the web server is tho. lol. now add the cronjob.
}{
That's odd. o.o. whats the maximum number of passed arguments and their size?. :). There is no proper way of doing this right?. change to 000 on the startup-file? Sure.. proper way of doing this, is adding what every you need to alter the files (most likely the user apache runs as) to the group that has permissions to the files.
}{
I can't believe I couldn't work out why that was happening.. ohh. anyone know of a PHP SSH client?. not completely tho?. no, not completely. i know you need root to run on port 80.
}{
but 777 means we could change all his files with ANY exploit. kevin, all depends on the distro, rather default apache(2).conf. hm, sorry. now it works :). you are a guru :). wiggles.. -t.
}{
wait.... lol. to a common group?. switched the arguements lol. that would be the easiest way, and still reasonably secure. ah, ok..
}{
ty. strictly properly, you should use a seperate group, not user1, but this should still be fine. pretty much*. erm. newgroup. *.

I must be tired, but you should get the idea :). yup!. listen to Myrtis.  He knows what he's talking about.. ah mvn. nvm*. hm.

that's probably a good idea. yeah me two. anyways, gtg later. peace. what?. HAH.

shut up. you did it right.  it might be your computer.. ;). hello. lol. :].

yeah.. ok. Denyse.  that's easy.. yes?. yeaaahhh.. existing tool? like squid?.

you're on the right track.. um, c is fast. You can get handy and get some PGP action going on. Malik, i dont want to supply a password, forgot that :). where it said encryptor and decryptor . :-). exactly Myrtis.

i like compilable distros.. lol. OpenBSD should be the only thing you run on a server!. we know. go ahead. they had two remote holes :P. it says, "need to be root".
}{
of course. no. Are you saying linux has no remote holes?. TWO remote holes! windows probably only has one exploitable right now!. Priscila 2, ever. there might be other apps?.
}{
Actually, I don't care what you think!. Lexie i usually add a "shutdown" account so that anyone can shut the machine down, they dont even have to be logged in.. >_<. hm, why don't we all just roll back to linux 1.0? That way, there'll be still exploits, just long forgotten ones! :p. lol Priscila. so Linux isn't secure..

&& Priscila  HEY! Our first flame/troll fest isn't scheduled 'till AFTER 9:30 EST today!   :-). Hermina I didn't get to linux yet. IMO linux is secure. :o). Linux?  Bah!. that's what Myrtis said.. Lizeth Start?.
}{
heh.. your opinions are very important. anyone an idea?. thanks Myrtis. i know. this psu has a blown ceramic capacitor.
}{
should I just try to replace it?. i think that was sarcasm Priscila. nut anus has a blown kevin ring. why doesn't he try using the flux capacitor?. Damn, i need to fix my sarcasm detector :-(. can I have yours?.

hmm, but that ReadMode just sends characters to the terminal, no?. lol Priscila. Malik, i dont have a root password. rofl. passwordless root account?. Lexie boot with init=/bin/sh and change root password.

}{
Does someone here know howto setup software RAID?. yeah. :\. Anastasia how are you booting? are you using an initrd or autodection. Kevin': I'm not sure, I just installed Feisty using the alternate CD.. It states the RAID array is working, but just doesn't boot..
}{
Kevin': How did you setup the array? It's software, right?. yes, linux md. maybe you need two instead of one.. raid5. probably related, actually. Kevin': I just hate the design of modern switching PSUs..
}{
Kevin': I was thinking of making my own.. what's wrong with a modern switching psu. k. makes sense. Kenin': Next I configured the RAID by adding sda1, sdb1 to md0, and sda2 and sdb2 to md1.. very great. thxx again :).
}{
Kevin': Do you think I should use RAID-5? Will that work?. Kevin': I'm just setting up a small webserver (800Mhz 256MB 2x10GB HD). I don't care about performance, I just want basic redundancy and the ability to boot.. what's the purpose of RAID again?. usually, redundancy. high availability.
}{
^. :/. it's kinda the point. 'inexpenseive 'disks' was my understanding. or you can use sata 10,000 rpm boys and kick ass. Anastasia I don't have a web browser running.
}{
oh, be sure to put the drives on seperate ide cables. you are doing this yes?. Kevin': Is that really necessary?. most likely. Kevin': Maybe that's the problem!. also you will get much better performance with seperate cables.
}{
probably not, since you partly booted. the problem is some stupid software thing. but a real failure could easily cause problems with the other drive on the cable. better performance with seperate ide cables?. yes, an IDE cable cannot multiplex.. i never knew that.
}{
Hey, I have a harddrive that's about 7 years old now, what are the chances of it suddenly failing?. normally you would donate those HDDs to younger brothers or sisters.. Meta ask SMART. /dev/hda2               115.3M    109.8M         0 100% /media/hda2. dmesg...forgot. I've got 3 HDs that are over 10 years old.
}{
that's a bit odd.. where is the rest of the space?. ive never raided ide started raid when i got my sata drives. but not out of space. it's all a luck of the draw thing. but that is really good to know.
}{
I have a 120MB IDE HD. I don't use it though (obviously..). Just did that... it still says the same. Virgie run it when unmounted, right?. my smallest is a 2 gigabyte fujitsu. I can run cat, but can't run tail.. yes, I did.
}{
what filesystem are you using. ext3. Reiser. buggered hard drive??. Virgie what's 115.3 minus 5% of 115.3?. it could just be reserved space. probably is actually.
}{
i just installed debian reiserfs. I am root. you can change it. Is it wise to change it?. it's an opinion thing. it would be the same thing.
}{
use ext3 though, since it has a journal. Hermina ?. explain that. ouch. yeah...raid is very usefull.. ever heard of raid1 or raid5 or raid10 ?.
}{
i liked raid 0 with windows but with linux i un raided my drives after i saw how stable it was. small 128M Flash IDE module. that's raid 0. yeah, your right. raid10 ftw. (at lower cost levels, you have to turn off the computer to replace the drive, but you still retain data).
}{
hot swap is nice....we use ultra 320, raids 5. raid arrays. I should back up this computer. maybe it can handle it. Malik, clamav is a virus scanner... not cleaner. usually documents with viruses are bogus though, are you sure this is useful data?.
}{
I don't think that many games will benefit since most of them cache all their data when they load up usually. any suggestions?. you can petition the lord with prayer. You CANNOT PETITION THE LORD...WITH PRAYER. anyone using grub2?. did you already try an fsck?.
}{
"Creationism is based upon science, reason and tons of evidence. Evolution is based on the blind acceptance of superstitions and fairy tales.". hookus pookus. War is peace; freedom is slavery.. IO error. my guess is that my raid controller is failing...unless 2 of my drives are down.. Anastasia just press e.
}{
um. Also gave me errors when I ran "root (hd0,0)". you mounted /dev and /proc?. I'm doing this on an already booted system.. since they are identical it doesn't matter. you mounted /dev and /proc?.
}{
was it running fine before?. I'm not sure, but the system is already booted.. It's been running fine since February 9 of this year. Kevin': What's the point? Neither HD can boot by itself.. my connection... it's dieding.. I can't imagine it being the drivers unless they were changed around when the problems started cropping up.
}{
what is the exact error message?. I have 2 almost duplicate systems...same hardware, same kernels...some different software running, but all Quinton software is the same.. Antonietta, Thank you.. Kevin': How will copyin the MBR help?. Anastasia I thought grub was already booting on both drives?. Kevin': It only boots when both HDs are present. When any 1 gets removed, it doesn't boot..
}{
hmmmm.    I'm probably going to tell dell that it is the raid controller.  I have to drive 200 miles to have physical access.. Anastasia does the bios detect the drives?. you have to buy a lot of gas.. and I fortify my diet w/ extra beans, so that helps too. are beans healthy?  just curious.. might not have the necessary fs drivers loaded.
}{
Kevin' , Gale: Is that easy to fix? I don't understand why it's so complicated just to setup a simple software RAID-1 array.. Anastasia it's an ubuntu problem. it shouldn't be compicated, but I don't know what the problem is, I don't use ubuntu :). Drivers? For RAID?. yeah. But it's software RAID. What kind of drivers?. pretty much any drivers to be able to utilize your HDs and root fs need to be loaded by that point.
}{
because ubuntu only works out of the box.  days later, it'll BSOD.. are you using the distro's Quinton image?. or is this a custom Quinton?. hi. http://www.ubuntu-in.org/wiki/SATA_RAID_Howto. Custom Quinton? I'm a Makeda to linux and don't even know shell cmds. I only know howto program VB..
}{
Miles thx. One of the HDs say "10GB AT compatible intelligent drive". They're all just EIDE HDs.. what is the best way to dump all the records of a country domain (.sg) ?. it's faster than 512b. system calls are very expensive.
}{
not a whole lot. but imaging a disk is a terrible way to back up things. I agree. any other alternatives?. it's better to keep your fs independant of your data. I just ran a smartctl -t long on /dev/hda and it reported back that the disks lifetime is 176 hours. bridging?.
}{
so, i'm kinda panicking here... you really should backup any important data regardless of anything anyway. whats the best linux os. debian. hi. Does Gnome have a financial application similar to MS Money?.
}{
gnucash. wow. cool slide :). backs up his /home. anyone good with BASH scripts here?. can anyone tell me a forum where to talk about c++ + linux?.

*yet. jre was installed via pkgtool. the ubuntu wikis have a good tutorial.. i think it was blackdown java.. symlink. what is a symlink.

remove their arms and legs, and turn off all the networking equipment.. you on windows?. Rachel, heh. when called with pkgtool. I suspect there is one somewhere, but I dont know of it.. any seasoned sysadmins around wth advice?.
}{
no. :-). yeah is where is the diffculty. Or is there some other attribute?. mvdir?. the trick is moving recursively..
}{
try asking #iptables too. ...but there's no fetch on this box.  Is there another clean alternative?. Hermina, the syntax being?. oh ok. thx. And to change a files name, you move it to the same direction but with another name?.
}{
s/direction/directory, but yes.. And I note that you don't need -R or -r on mv. Unlike cp, recursion is not needed to move directories.. you don't need to use -R. oops, typo. nvm, someone beat me to it. Since, fundamentally, "move" and "rename" are the same option (at least across one filesystem).
}{
...which one?. Er.. Requests it, I think.. Hmm.. "just visits the URL" is kind of nonsensical.. Anyways..
}{
-q will disable output.. --spider will disable downloading.. --delete-after will download the files but not save them.. thats how I do?. yep.. Trying, thanks.

}{
hello. any idea?. but didn't change. ?. hm. try #svn too. yeah, I'm covering my bases.
}{
ok :). Hi all. anyone know how to pipe output into a log???. thanks thats perfect. Does anybody here know anything about airsnort?. Aron, like what?.
}{
Jeanelle, looks like a key problem on the server. hm, how would I debug/fix it?. Well on their page, they say that it takes 50 - X Million packets to sniff the encryption key.. how long will that take on a 4 Ghz with 1 gb ram, and a 1 TB hard-drive?. none of those things matter, all that matters is how much data is coming over the network. not very long.  a few minutes..
}{
proclaims .. I did it! \o/. Hermina, ok.... the wlan is a 54mbps 802.11g.... how big is a typical single wlan packet?. ok, so my question now is.. is there a way to pipe the output of svnadmin dump (it dumps the contents to the console, so you'd normally use svnadmin dump blah > file.bak) to gzip?. ok..
}{
any tips how I'd figure out what's wrong / fix it?. not sure myself. anybody know that about airsnort?. cause i really need to know.. i'm gonna attempt a wlan airsnort on a windows vista machine.. woot. thanks =) Forgot the >.

yw. eh eh?. right?. two directories up I have a dir: movies. ok. congratulations on learning how to use cp..

its wrong. :P. really needs to go to an airsnort support channel, but there is apparently not one.. why like the teacher?. he hard coded those values. so it ditches correct syntax too.

now I'm back on the same question. so, what's the error it gives when you try?. Lajuana, Georgia error I get is "You get 0 out of 1 point". .... that's useful. my teachers homepage.
}{
LoL. and, y'know, wrong. And the question is?. :P. (the answer, I think, is "your teacher is a dick"). o wait....
}{
nvm. Tell your teacher they score nil point. Yeah, tell them to try reading "man mv" !. There's no -r to mv.. AMG :P. you don't need -r, definitely.
}{
You sure your teacher isn't using Windows? also, try "cp folder1 folder2/". Aron, why would I create a note on my own comp?. copying. PERL :). that's why Larraine. what is it you need? most languages have extension graphics libraries like GD.
}{
not it paint handler. that's the lowdown.... the trailing / will cause it to copy the directory contents rather than the directory itself.. .files meaning?. .htaccess and such?. will it preserve permissions e.g. on /files/ dir....
}{
matrix_autobrowse.sh. #!/bin/bash. Where all the domains are.... it just shows you pages on the internet, and you have no idea how it'll come together.. that basic idea could be formed into a specific interest base browser.. pretty f'n cool huh?.

I dont think the Mbit/s is base_2. don't forget async transfers, and protocol over head.. Bennett, using 1024 instead of 1000 gave me ~4.63. no results. rpncalc 15000000 8/ 31 24* 60* 60** 1024/ 1024/ 1024/ 1024/. Anyways.

's. that's how many tb/m. that's the lowdown mofo. i rock and stuff and junk. any 1?. ok.
}{
yo!. you got that?. mine is the perfect answer!. Aron, what's the "38.31481933593750000000"?. hi. 38.31481933593750000000.
}{
Hermina:. and that applys to either upstream or downstream. that's a lot of terabytes. well 15mbps is pretty crazy. pwnt. that's the problem with corporate distros.  they think they got you taken care of..
}{
no what i did, is right.. sigh :(. s/was/is/. sure.. and i got my result. you are correct..
}{
except its not 15 MegeBytes per second, its 15 Megabits per second. Bennett, correct 15Megabits/second.  (~1.875MegaBytes/seconds). hello @lll. Aron, no. byte -> kilo -> mega -> giga -> tera. "" -> "kilo" -> "mega" -> "giga" -> "tera".
}{
"buttload". y = 1048576. Remember CaSe is important: M=Mega, m=milli, B=Byte, b=bits. ah. kk.. Aron, your "y" is wrong. nope..
}{
k. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=1+terabyte+in+megabytes&btnG=Google+Search. y / 15 = 69905.0 "6" repeating. :). you have forgotten that the 15 is not MB, its Mb. Aron sounds crazy when he says that..
}{
15 Mb ~ 1.875 MB. what was the original question anyway?  heh. 2+2. What's the problem?. probably driver issues. heh ...
}{
 1 terabibble. jesus!. result = 2678400/69905.0666666. thats it ok.... Yes my son?. except the  1048576/15 where you divide Mega bytes with Mega bits.
}{
mb!. yep. megabytes!. mb is millibuts. b00b00. remember mbps is megaBITS, bot Bytes....
}{
*not. 4.86 TB a month. erm Aron. " 4 TeraByte transfer per month, on a 100Megabit/s port". probably a good figure is cents per bitsecond. can you hot swap IDE drives?.
}{
that's the isp provision. 10ths of cents. ahhh, ok. How about Redemptive Coupon Value ..in .00ths of cents ..lol. I can't believe it caused this much messing about!. 10Mb == 1MB, or 8Mb == 1MB ?.
}{
8 Mb == 1 MB. so you're working to powers of 2, not 10. isn't that the baud rate rather than the "actual bits received" figure ?. right.... er Gibi and Tibi ..lol. er tebi.
}{
pebi and pubic. so founf out that sendmail.mc is missing.. I disagree - the bits/s' infers base 2, and Mbits/s therefore is 1024x1024bits/s. so 10Mb/s == 1MB/s ?. roughly yes.. yep.
}{
I've always worked to base 2, seems daft to confuse them!. LOL. 1 byte received == ~10 bits transferred. 11 bits!. because they are transmitted. depends on protocol/encoding and other things.
}{
8/10b encoding yo. serialize that sucka. so 10 bits transferred per byte received is correct.... only on the actual ethernet physical layer. a likely story !. Hello.
}{
Do you know how can I remove the DC offest on fly?. DC offset?. district of columbia?. From my microphone. Direct connect?. lol.
}{
you've identified a very important feature. have you got a spectrum analyzer going ?. Angla, I've detected it with audacity. Angla, but some days ago I hadn't got any problems. Is it possible to place a quota on a ramdisk?. audacity has a provision to correct that iirc .. not that it's awesome or anything. Felicia, no....
}{
lol. that's a hardware issue so probably not. http://img472.imageshack.us/img472/7876/screenqu0.jpg. my ... you did. apologies Terresa. np :).
}{
my bad. lol. f'cker ..lol. is the offset caused the by microphone itself? or the sound hardware?. Dagny, I don't know. it takes a fair amount of bias to cause distortion..
}{
Everything was perfect some days ago. Becki, not really distortion, but annoying high pitch. indeed. I can't explain it :D. http://img472.imageshack.us/img472/7876/screenqu0.jpg. yup, that is some DC offset :).
}{
some EE expert should know.  I know this is a stupid suggestion, but...  wiggle every plug to the microphone around, unlug them, plug them back in, and try again.. good point, offset doesn't by itself cause major distortion. yes, bad card. No :S. Everyone pile over to #hardware :p.
}{
I've muted and unplugged everything. There's still the offset. i dunno ..see http://www.ipsec-howto.org/x501.html. So I have to change my mobo :). Thank you. ugh, on-board sound.  :).
}{
 you might be able to adjust something on the mobo itself. :D. boooooooooooom. thx anyway. Becki, anyway I've been having some errors with this new setup. You've just consigned every laptop user to hell :p.
}{
So I think I should change the mobo. nope, creative has PCMCIA soundblasters:). I'm having compiling errors...segfaults. Like i'm gonna carry the damned speakers around like a boom-box! lol.  what motherboard is this?. Well, true, but with integrated HDA now, an external card is rarely required.
}{
I assume one could attach headphones:). asrock 4coredual-vsta. Very cheap. I've been working with a bluetooth headset, thats cook. ^cool^. How can I know why my system froze? Logs are not helpful..

Now I have to go. Bye.  check your power supply.. ok. ok :). Thanks.

Dagny, to frustrate and anger you. sleepers. sounds like congress. ADSL/cable have a lot to answer for!. ... but they all end up here eventually. damn. you must be new. come on in, you have lots to learn ;).

you. lol. lol. i doubt it mentions it. You need to get out more, Elenore :). I've noticed that most guys have nipples too..
}{
i have 3. me too. Tractors have nipples too :). well. 2.5, really. and expect peeps about?. ???.
}{
hello. would you guys recommend me some lightweight linux proxy server?. heh. but I don't have tractor-sized nipple clamps.  only the other kind.  :). You don't clamps, just a big grease-gun :). Craig, beat me to it :P.
}{
^need^. try that http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.ipsec.html.  but lube and nipple clamps don't work together well...  makes them slide off unless you tighten them reallly tight.  :).

heh. Our goats don't get used.... ... only abused :p. All them townies that come visiting, weirdos :). actually, I've never heard of nipples on tractors...  I've heard of them on 5th-wheel hitches, plumbing parts, and lots of other things, though.... Grease-nipples all over furry.

well enough to not use it :). Input gain?. dunno.  have you seen the iGasm that's pissing apple off so much?  :). iPhone?. well i need to figure out the issues of why sendmail does not want to recompile using m4. iSpank iMonkey.
}{
Pete, what is it doing when you try to run it?. iPos. I wouldn't mind Spencer igasm, but I'd probably just build one...  a little pwm controller driven off Spencer audio input and a $3 vibrating egg.. rather than a $50 toy.  heh.. Now it's perfect :S. i bet it's a bad connection between the jack/input.
}{
No. Weird. get jiggy with it. no. uhm. Ubuntu cannot detect it, is there a cmd like "lspci" to list the device using the parallel port?.
}{
With Input Gain 0,5/1 it's perfect. So should I reboot?. no.  how would that help?. Is there a way to get it to work then?. bah, now I'll spend the rest of the day thinking about nipple clamps and vibrating eggs.  Dagny:  it's all your fault.  :). Hi..

guilty! , by way of innuendo. Glennis, yeah ?. oven time?. Josphine, now your calling me senseless. no im calling your talking senseless. you're knowledge is lagging behind and your not skillful.

knew it.. xD. probably. does some extraneous babbling. Arlie, because i found out the mb has on board sound, just need to d/l the also driver. Glennis, there you go. i bet you just ran out of RAM ..lol.

nope i got plenty o' ram. lol swapspace ..cat ate through the wire?. thats not what im doing Arlie ... data. is this another f'ken homework eejut question?. hrm.

now i'm thinking it's a software problem. didn't you say some codecs just didn't work?. some lbsap shit or somesuch. okie, thanks again. it was working fine a few hours ago. well i have some cheapo mics sitting around so that shouldnt be a prob.
}{
grr. /dev/dsp is there!!. maybe the song ended ..lol. heh, nope. it's playing. Bennett, right.
}{
comparet to pure white noise anyway. Bennett, there might be some rotational element to it, but it shouldnt be constant or predictable. well I would expect it to have no abrupt changes. Bennett, it can sound regular and still not be regular. so 2 samples following each other would tend to be similiar (I expect, I've not tried this). sure.
}{
I turned my computer off before i went out, so there's no chance that some process raped it... artsd or esd may have stolen it or something. sure there is. thanks Felicia. welcome. Bennett, he's not recording the fan.
}{
Bennett, he's recording the fan + the air flow past the mic. Bennett, its white noise. isn't using kde. but it's running ..lol. want me to catch it? :p and no it's not running. Bennett, have you ever blown into a microphone attached to a pa ?.
}{
Bennett, or seen the wind screens professional recording people use ?. sure (to the first one) still not convinced its very white. Bennett, the wind screens prevent "hiss" ... aka white noise. so any one going to post?. Bennett, because the air flow into and around the mic element is turbulent. yup their loaded....
}{
probably something horrendulously simple... curses god. he could. kills a puffin. Bennett, its the closest thing to random he's gonna get without a hardware random number generator. Bennett, i also suggested he could use Spencer fm tuner card, but his box has a sound card already.
}{
but its probably alot better than nothing. poor lil' puffin .. what he'd do?. boots to windows to check that it's a problem with oss/alsa. when i try to load linux it just takes me to a grub terminal... any ideas on how to fix  this?. typing whatever magic string (not entirely magic) fits your system setup. yo.
}{
yay my sound is back. damn aumix was muting my pcm1. sits down and listens to Burzum. or well Spencer old alpha with netBSD, but that never actually worked properly. ?. the etch cd's have a rescue mode option.
}{
Angel, you could also boot into Ubuntu and try to repair the grub installation.. ight i'll try that. hello. is the linux Quinton licensed under the GPL or the LGPL or some other license?. GPL. mailx I think.
}{
Evenink!. thanks. SMPT is really simple.. *SMTP.. thats sad.... I have spent ~20 hours on this issue (no I am not crazy), reinstalled Ubuntu 6 times, erasing the HDs everytimg..
}{
thats pointless. You can boot wa RAID1 partition _without_ sw RAID.. With all of this erasing, partitioning, formatting, reinstalling, rebooting, I think the HDs are better off on their own than RAID.. thats one of the big advantages of RAID1.. hi. ok. ok.
}{
What's a good way to pipe output to different locations depending on a regex match?. anyhow you can tell the MD (or DM) RAID sw that it is a damaged RAID and that it is missing one of the two halves.. i've got some apps to try.  :). Where would I run that cmd?. (as a Quinton parameter). anyhow a couple of useful links to follow..
}{
http://radu.rendec.ines.ro/howto/raid1.html. http://www.linux.com/howtos/Software-RAID-0.4x-HOWTO-4.shtml. on second thoughts, that probably won't help. it seems that the option is only relevant to raid5/6.. /tmp/mc-root/mcusrdyHF6d: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied Any body Spencer idea why that happnes?. it used to work before, not I get this message. use -tunap maybe.
}{
ok. Chrystal, are you root?. and | widget, or similar. i think together with -e it also shows the user.. no, I'm Chrystal :)  (retrying). that will need some tuning, but that's the basic structure.
}{
Bruno_:  /sbin/sh exhists, 0755 and owner and group is root:root (sh symlinks to bash). sorry.... /bin7sh exists. ah, very good. Thanks, Lajuana. Bruno_: that was a typo, sorry.... /bin/sh symlinks to /bin/bash. raid level? and only involves md? or are there layers of lvm and stuffs.
}{
software RAID-1, md0-2. I don't think my suggestion will work anyway.. I'll just switch to Microsoft Windows Server 2003-It worked perfectly.. lol. hah. Is Windows 2003 that much worse than Ubuntu?.
}{
thems fightin words. slaps Anastasia around with a large trout. I can also execute the shell.... hi. software. have you ever had Linux softRAID  working on that box?.
}{
what Candice said is valid. you can add grub entries where root is changed to be either constituent partition of the array.. found it!!!. amule. what application you using. use ktorrent or azureus. you mean slapt-get ?:D.
}{
Felicia, speak up. welcome. Felicia,. :-p. your welcome ... swaret --install amule.
}{
how the heck should i know Izola. Kathleen:. Izola?. Kathleen. bastage nicks. no my wifey puter.
}{
wtf is that?. Bruno_: I symlinked /tmp/mc-root/ to /root/mc-root and now it all works. I'm just saying what's wrong. I don't even know what a "mock rescue" is. I'm trying to get a solution to a problem. I have spent several hours today trying to get it to work.. i just change the nick it oinvolves a long password. 15 chat=racters so thats why i dont changwe nick. i still don;t understand your dilemma i guess .. i scrolled back a bit .. but can you explain again what exactly you want to do?.. and tell us your Hardwrae and Kernel versions.
}{
I'm just trying to setup software RAID-1. I'm using the Feisty alternate CD.. ok .. but you askede why i hit a wrong nick .. and explaining to you, b/c it's all your fault :-P. can't you use ssh?. have you ever had Linux RAID working on that box?. sounds like the data center i used to work in..... Georgia RAID is working. Problem is it doesn't boot off either HD by itself..
}{
In other words, it only boots when both HDs are present.. is there a separate /boot partition?. md0=Ext3 /; md1=swap; md2=Ex3 /boot. you need to mirror that .. are these IDE, or Sata? or ... EIDE. partitions are linked to md, equally sized..
}{
grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/md2 .. but you should've mirrored each of those before creating your md devices. er s/use ndo/use a md0. or root=LABEL=<labelname> ... use find.. er gah. 0wn3d..
}{
No no no no.. ouch. is there any api documentation about device-mapper ?. ;). I have a beige G3 Macintosh running Yellowdog 3.1 and Quinton 2.4.33, I'm trying to get the printer working, it's attached t the printer serial port and it's a color style writer 4500.  I want to know what the serial settings should be and what printer .ppd I should use (i suspect the HP one[s] because it's basically Spencer apple branded hp deskjet).. I don't know then, sorry. it works fine on my system but I'm using a pretty lightweight distro and no initrd or anything like that..
}{
It should be.... path can be a pattern! sweet. I'm switching to Windows.. shame on you. is DEEPLY offended. Anastasia, considering your problems I understand.
}{
I am going to go out and beat up children, i'm that offended.. use the Force!. Anastasia, that is kind of backwards =P. btw, are you not able to get access to the console atm? you haven't actually run any of the tests that I suggested.. Anybody familiar with linux on a macintosh?. Anastasia - Yes.
}{
(sigh) fine... Now I have to get up, reconnect all the cables, change boot options, and rewrite them on paper.... I'm not trying to bend your ear ;). or has there been some corruption/malfunction?. omg a *WHOLE* day wasted on RAID. I must have gone crazy.. I power down the computer, disconnect the HD, and change the jumper on the other one so BIOS could recognize it.. ok.
}{
what are the devices that you're using ... sda and sdb?. you can. Woa, are you serious? Is this the only way? Wow.. Jacklyn, there are many ways.. grasshopper. Which one is wrong, the first point or the second?.
}{
Jacklyn, `cp -av /dir1 /dir2`. gulp. That puts a copy of dir1 into dir2.. Jacklyn, bre creative :). s/bre/be. Yea, I will. I'll use rsync..
}{
Hehe. what is it that you're trying to do? just clone the directory?. Sounds good to me. No, I need to copy the contents of one directory into another, overwriting what might be there.. ;). http://sial.org/pbot/25140 I got errors-invalid partition table..
}{
no it won't.. --keep I think.. Or yea what Lajuana said.. I think the point here is just to merge the directories.. eh, but that's why rdiff was created, because rsyn didn't have that ability.. But it said that /dev/md* contains Spencer invalid partition table..
}{
I was about to ask a question about that. It booted md0 (the root partition) but my /boot partition is md2-should I change it?. fstab: http://sial.org/pbot/25142. menu.lst: http://sial.org/pbot/25143. mdstat was empty.. k. http://img477.imageshack.us/my.php?image=somegj3.jpg\.
}{
but that's not relevant right now because you're unplugging a disk completely ;). so the reamaining disk is the first one detected by the BIOS so grub is OK there.. But it's not.... gentoo (it's DIY all the way there). yall ever heard of a mother-in-law plan?. They had no clue..
}{
Anyone here get google earth workin on linux.. with Spencer ATI card?  its Spencer x1600. Why not use gaia ?. Yuriko, ......what's so hard about this? get the installer, run it, and execute "googleearth". centos or gentoo or debian. not unless you're pro. is that a trick question?.
}{
I'm a Makeda.. gentoo will scare ya. it scared me, so yea.. centOS?. I know debian\netBSD is complex.. centos is aight, but i never really used it.
}{
not really. debian is quite easy actually. yup. gentoo is better.... unless ya installing it on a laptop, wanna get some crazy wireless running or bluetooth or whatever new stuff. Gale, Nada: So I don't have to spend hours trying to recover RAID?.

never played with raid, so don't know . :(. hmm ... http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-420993.html. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdadm/+bug/108971. those issues aren't dissimilar. So it's a bug! Should I use Debian then?.

Also, doesn't Debian use up a lot of HD space? I only have 10GB.. no. heck no. is there some program that can talk to GTalk ?. (for linux of course). GTalkTalk?  ;).

slow = fast. war = peace. ekiga?. terrorist = freedomfighter. ah, dunno it. yeah, ekiga softphone, it is using SIP protocol.
}{
I think not, it is a different protocol. too. anyway, I'm off. hope you figure it out.. *sobb*. you doing peyote or something?. controller? I need to specify that?.
}{
cacti the rrd thng. you ain't booting without controller support ..lol .. but i suspect your problem was a remapping of drives incorrectly (or lack thereof) .. still no answers eh?. grub and fstab are two off hand. still no controller name Gale, <sigh>. but we can get that up and running. I've only caught bits and pieces of what's going on with that.
